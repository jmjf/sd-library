In this series of meditations on seven of Tanizaki's novels and novellas, the renowned translator Anthony Chambers explores the attempt by Tanizaki's characters to construct ideal worlds: fantasies that were far removed from the concerns of everyday life and were, for the most part, unattainable. Chambers focuses on the thread of fantasy that Tanizaki weaves throughout his work; he examines the writer's subtle use of storytelling devices to evoke his characters' alternate sense of reality and encourage the reader's participation in their fantasies. Using his intimate knowledge of Tanizaki's works, Chambers superbly evokes the beauty and truth Tanizaki's characters find in their ideal worlds","subjects":["Droomwereld","Fictie","18.87 Japanese language and literature"],"publisherName":"Distributed by Harvard University Press","publishedDate":"1994","resourceId":"22c9999b-7f2b-4cab-8c51-051a1cff0407"},{"title":"The secret history of the Lord of Musashi ; and, Arrowroot","subtitle":"","authors":[{"authorName":"Tanizaki, Jun'ichirō","roleTerm":"creator"}],"lcCallNumber":"PL839.A7 A23 1982","ddCallNumber":"895.6/34","isbn":"0394524543","abstract":"","subjects":["Japanese fiction — Translations into English","Japanese fiction"],"publisherName":"Knopf","publishedDate":"1982","resourceId":"d17eb611-9beb-4036-8aab-5ab42358991a"},{"title":"Childhood years","subtitle":"a memoir","authors":[{"authorName":"Tanizaki, Jun'ichirō","roleTerm":"creator"},{"authorName":"McCarthy, Paul","roleTerm":"translator"}],"lcCallNumber":"PL839.A7 Z47813 1988","ddCallNumber":"","isbn":"0870118633 (U.S.)","abstract":"","subjects":["Childhood and youth","Authors, Japanese — Biography — 20th century"],"publisherName":"Kodansha International","publishedDate":"1988","resourceId":"b67a444f-198c-4a1a-883c-26cd6c552345"},{"title":"The saga of Dazai Osamu","subtitle":"a critical study with translations","authors":[{"authorName":"Lyons, Phyllis I","roleTerm":"creator"}],"lcCallNumber":"PL825.A8 Z74117 1985","ddCallNumber":"","isbn":"0804711976","abstract":"","subjects":["Translations, English","Authors, Japanese — Biography — 20th century"],"publisherName":"Stanford University Press","publishedDate":"1985","resourceId":"45155557-65e7-4593-b4fb-252883437c05"},{"title":"Naomi","subtitle":"","authors":[{"authorName":"Tanizaki, Jun'ichirō","roleTerm":"creator"}],"lcCallNumber":"PL839.A7 C513 1985","ddCallNumber":"","isbn":"0394536630","abstract":"","subjects":["Translations into English","Japanese fiction — Translations into English — 20th century"],"publisherName":"Knopf","publishedDate":"1985","resourceId":"c7cd2851-2ba6-47bf-9015-41ec8b3d9c88"},{"title":"The reed cutter ; and, Captain Shigemoto's mother","subtitle":"two novellas","authors":[{"authorName":"Tanizaki, Jun'ichirō","roleTerm":"creator"}],"lcCallNumber":"PL839.A7 A9413 1994","ddCallNumber":"895.6/344","isbn":"067942010X","abstract":"","subjects":["Translations into English"],"publisherName":"A.A.

An innocent bystander, a cunning thief, a flirtatious wife, a psychic, even the ghost of thte murdered man are all caught in a web of deceit, where everyone's truth may be a lie. \"Gloryday\" set in present-day New York City, introduces a priest during a crisis of faith after a terrible tragedy strikes the city. Disillusioned and angry, he plays a practical joke and posts an anonymous letter in Central Park, declaring that Christ will appear, rising from the pond. At first, the joke is embraced by an unstable CPA, who has chosen to live in the wilds of the park. Soon others begin to believe in the miracle, including a drug-addicted actress and a bitter reporter--even the priest's atheist aunt. On the day of the miracle, a storm blows through the Park, and only the priest sees his lie become a truth","subjects":["Musicals — Librettos"],"publisherName":"Dramatists Play Service Inc","publishedDate":"c2007","resourceId":"ee0843df-e187-4d0a-87de-61743061dbd8"},{"title":"Murder in the age of enlightenment","subtitle":"essential stories","authors":[{"authorName":"Akutagawa, Ryūnosuke","roleTerm":""},{"authorName":"Karetnyk, Bryan","roleTerm":"translator"},{"authorName":"ProQuest (Firm)","roleTerm":""}],"lcCallNumber":"PL801.K8 A2 2020","ddCallNumber":"895.6344","isbn":"9781782275565 (electronic bk.)","abstract":"","subjects":[],"publisherName":"Pushkin Press","publishedDate":"2020","resourceId":"1b1161d1-6559-49b8-91b6-bcdff633b647"},{"title":"Kawakami Otojirō Sadayakko ten","subtitle":"Otojirō botsugo hyakunen Sadayakko seitan hyakushijūnen kinen","authors":[{"authorName":"Chigasaki-shi Bijutsukan","roleTerm":""}],"lcCallNumber":"","ddCallNumber":"","isbn":"","abstract":"","subjects":["Criticism and interpretation","Actors — History and criticism — Japan — 20th century"],"publisherName":"Chigasaki-shi Bunka Shinkō Zaidan : Chigasaki-shi Bijutsukan","publishedDate":"2011","resourceId":"6dd82d55-66f3-4cc1-b3d6-65ea1b0a8c8f"},{"title":"Diary of a mad old man","subtitle":"","authors":[{"authorName":"Tanizaki, Jun'ichirō","roleTerm":"creator"},{"authorName":"Hibbett, Howard","roleTerm":"translator"}],"lcCallNumber":"PZ3.T1626 Di","ddCallNumber":"","isbn":"","abstract":"\"The Key (1961), as those who read it will unquestionably remember, was the diary of a middled-aged man's fetishistic pursuit of passion and it had a very definite (some found distasteful) aberrant fascination.

He is 77, and from his toothless mouth to his prostate, with a severe neuralgic condition and high blood pressure in between, his many physical disabilities are recorded here with as great fidelity as is awarded his diminishing erotic returns. The latter are achieved through his daughter-in-law, Satsuko, a former chorus dancer, who indulges him deliberately; sometimes she lets the old man kiss her feet in order to secure a 15 carat cat's eye ring.

Made accessible in English by the expertise of translators Anthony H. Chambers and Paul McCarthy, the stories in The Gourmet Club vividly explore an array of human passions. In \"The Children,\" three mischievous friends play sadomasochistic games in a mysterious Western-style mansion. The sybaritic narrator of \"The Secret\" experiments with cross-dressing as he savors the delights of duplicity. \"The Two Acolytes\" evokes the conflicting attractions of spiritual fulfillment and worldly pleasure in medieval Kyoto. In the title story, the seductive tastes, aromas, and textures of outlandish Chinese dishes blend with those of the seductive hands that proffer them to blindfolded gourmets. In \"Mr. Bluemound,\" Tanizaki, who wrote for a film studio in the early 1920s, considers the relationship between a flesh-and-blood actress and her image fixed on celluloid, which one memorably degenerate admirer is obsessed with. And, finally, \"Manganese Dioxide Dreams\" offers a tantalizing insight into the author's mind as he weaves together the musings of an old man very like Tanizaki himself-Chinese and Japanese cuisine, a French murder movie, Chinese history, and the contents of a toilet bowl.

Little known in his lifetime, he died at 37 from tuberculosis, but has since become a much loved children's author whose magical tales have been translated into many languages, adapted for the stage and turned into films and animations. Recognition for his poetry came much later. \"Strong in the Rain\"--The title-poem of this selection - is now arguably the most memorised and quoted modern poem in Japan. Both intensely lyrical and permeated with a sophisticated scientific understanding of the universe, Kenji Miyazawa's poems testify to his deep love of humanity and nature. From a young age, he was fascinated by plants, insects, and especially minerals, which he collected. At school, his interest in nature deepened, and he began poring through books on philosophy and Buddhism, which were to strongly influence his later writing. Miyazawa drew on nature in a way that no modern Japanese author had before him. Where other writers tended to use it as a springboard for their own meditations, he saw himself not just as nature's faithful chronicler and recorder but as its medium: light, wind and rain are processed through him before being recreated on the page. His mode of active engagement with nature set him apart from virtually all other Japanese poets, and led to his work being largely ignored by the Bundan (the literary establishment) and misunderstood for half a century. But in the 1990s, he received unprecedented attention in the Japanese media. The compassion, empathy and closeness to nature expressed in Kenji Miyazawa's poems and tales appealed strongly to a new generation of readers. -- Product Description from Website","subjects":["Translations into English"],"publisherName":"Bloodaxe Books","publishedDate":"2007","resourceId":"4a6edc97-046a-48dc-9e05-08107bff905a"},{"title":"Once and forever","subtitle":"","authors":[{"authorName":"Miyazawa, Kenji","roleTerm":""},{"authorName":"Bester, John","roleTerm":"translator"}],"lcCallNumber":"PL833.I95 A2 2018","ddCallNumber":"895.63/44","isbn":"9781681372600","abstract":"\"A collection of classic, fantastical tales from Northern Japan that are equal parts whimsical and sophisticated, perfect for readers of all ages.

Miyazawa was a teacher of agriculture by profession and largely unknown as a poet until after his death.

This volume includes poems translated by Gary Snyder, who was the first to translate a substantial body of Miyazawa's work into English. Hiroaki Sato's own superb translations, many never before published, demonstrate his deep familiarity with Miyazawa's poetry. His remarkable introduction considers the poet's significance and suggests ways for contemporary readers to approach his work.

Barbara Kawakami has created a vivid picture highlighted by little-known facts gleaned from extensive interviews, from study of preserved pieces of clothing and how they were constructed, and from the literature. She shows that as the cloth preferred by the immigrants shifted from kasuri (tie-dyed fabric from Japan) to palaka (heavy cotton cloth woven in a white plaid pattern on a dark blue background) so too their outlooks shifted from those of foreigners to those of Japanese Americans. Chapters on wedding and funeral attire present a cultural history of the life events at which they were worn, and the examination of work, casual, and children's clothing shows us the social fabric of the issei (first-generation Japanese).

Yet even though generations of Japanese high school students have been expected to memorize passages from his novels and he is routinely voted the most important Japanese writer in national polls, he remains less familiar to Western readers in comparison to authors such as Kawabata, Tanizaki, and Mishima.In this biography, John Nathan provides a lucid and vivid account of a great writer laboring to create a remarkably original oeuvre in spite of the physical and mental illness that plagued him all his life. He traces Soseki's complex and contradictory character, offering rigorous close readings of Soseki's groundbreaking experiments with narrative strategies, irony, and multiple points of view as well as recounting excruciating hospital stays and recurrent attacks of paranoid delusion. Drawing on previously untranslated letters and diaries, published reminiscences, and passages from Soseki's fiction, Nathan renders intimate scenes of the writer's life and distills a portrait of a tormented yet unflaggingly original author. This biography elevates Soseki to his rightful place as a great synthesizer of literary traditions and a brilliant chronicler of universal experience who, no less than his Western contemporaries, anticipated the modernism of the twentieth century.\"--","subjects":["Novelists, Japanese — Biography — 20th century","Novelists, Japanese"],"publisherName":"Columbia University Press","publishedDate":"","resourceId":"b030962f-0a5c-457e-841b-e437f9fe1cb0"},{"title":"Runaway horses","subtitle":"","authors":[{"authorName":"Mishima, Yukio","roleTerm":"creator"},{"authorName":"Gallagher, Michael","roleTerm":"tr"}],"lcCallNumber":"PZ3.M6878 Se vol. 2","ddCallNumber":"895.6/3/5","isbn":"0394466187","abstract":"\"Yukio Mishima's Runaway Horses is the second novel in his masterful tetralogy, The Sea of Fertility.

We live in such days. Pandemics. Threats to ʻāina. Political dysfunction, cultural appropriation, and disrespect. But also powerful surges toward sustainability, autonomy, and sovereignty.The first two volumes of The Value of Hawaiʻi (Knowing the Past, Facing the Future and Ancestral Roots, Oceanic Visions) ignited public conversations, testimony, advocacy, and art for political and social change. These books argued for the value of connecting across our different expertise and experiences, to talk about who we are and where we are going.In a world in crisis, what does Hawaiʻi’s experience tell us about how to build a society that sees opportunities in the turning and changing times? As islanders, we continue to grapple with experiences of racism, colonialism, environmental damage, and the costs of modernization, and bring to this our own striking creativity and histories for how to live peacefully and productively together. Steered by the four scholars who edited the previous volumes, The Value of Hawaiʻi 3: Hulihia, the Turning offers multigenerational visions of a Hawaiʻi not defined by the United States. Community leaders, cultural practitioners, artists, educators, and activists share exciting paths forward for the future of Hawaiʻi, on topics such as education, tourism and other economies, elder care, agriculture and food, energy and urban development, the environment, sports, arts and culture, technology, and community life.These visions ask us to recognize what we truly value about our home, and offer a wealth of starting points for critical and productive conversations together in this time of profound and permanent change","subjects":["Quality of life — Hawaii"],"publisherName":"University of Hawaii Press","publishedDate":"","resourceId":"56e655de-32fb-4923-a690-863a7c84f074"},{"title":"The miner","subtitle":"","authors":[{"authorName":"Natsume, Sōseki","roleTerm":"creator"}],"lcCallNumber":"PL812.A8 K5713 1988","ddCallNumber":"895.6/34","isbn":"0804714606","abstract":"","subjects":["Translation into English"],"publisherName":"Stanford University Press","publishedDate":"1988","resourceId":"dc208913-631c-4df9-bdf1-d1dcd7ab771d"},{"title":"The Tower of London","subtitle":"tales of Victorian London","authors":[{"authorName":"Natsume, Sōseki","roleTerm":"creator"},{"authorName":"Flanagan, Damian","roleTerm":""}],"lcCallNumber":"DA687.T7 N3813 2005","ddCallNumber":"895.6342","isbn":"0720612349 (pbk.)","abstract":"The spectacle of a Japanese visitor to Victorian London was a rare one, and Natusme Soseki's observations contain unique snapshots of London life.

The Maids concerns all the young women who work -- before, during, and after WWII -- in the pampered, elegant household of the famous author Chikura Raikichi, his wife Sanko, and her younger sister. Though quite well-to-do, Raikichi has a small house: the family and the maids (usually a few, sharing a little room next to the kitchen) are on top of one another. This proximity helps to explain Raikichi's extremely close observation of the maids and their daily lives, although his interest carries with it more than a dash of the erotic, calling to mind Tanizaki's raciest books such as Diary of a Mad Old Man and The Key. In the sensualist, semi-innocent, sexist patrician Raikichi, Tanizaki offers a richly ironic self-portrait, but he presents as well a moving, nuanced chronicle of change and loss: centuries-old values and manners are vanishing, and here -- in the evanescent beauty of the small gestures and intricacies of private life -- we find a whole world to be mourned. And yet, there is such vivacity and such beauty of writing that Tanizaki creates an intensely compelling epic in a kitchen full of lively girls. Ethereally suggestive, sensational yet serious, witty but psychologically complex, The Maids is in many ways The Makioka Sisters revisited in a lighter, more comic mode\"--","subjects":["Women household employees — Fiction","Manners and customs","Women household employees","Social life and customs — Fiction — Japan"],"publisherName":"New Directions Publishing Corporation","publishedDate":"2017","resourceId":"98174b5f-c8f9-4a0b-8b44-e1cde6108898"},{"title":"Childhood Years","subtitle":"","authors":[{"authorName":"Tanizaki, Jun'ichir o","roleTerm":"creator"},{"authorName":"McCarthy, Paul","roleTerm":""},{"authorName":"Michigan Publishing (University of Michigan)","roleTerm":"publisher"}],"lcCallNumber":"PL839.A7 Z47813 2017","ddCallNumber":"","isbn":"9780472123346","abstract":"In Childhood Years, originally published serially in a literary magazine between 1955 and 1956, Tanizaki Jun'ichiro (1886-1965) takes a meandering look back on his early life in Tokyo.

We live in such days. Pandemics. Threats to ʻāina. Political dysfunction, cultural appropriation, and disrespect. But also powerful surges toward sustainability, autonomy, and sovereignty.The first two volumes of The Value of Hawaiʻi (Knowing the Past, Facing the Future and Ancestral Roots, Oceanic Visions) ignited public conversations, testimony, advocacy, and art for political and social change. These books argued for the value of connecting across our different expertise and experiences, to talk about who we are and where we are going.In a world in crisis, what does Hawaiʻi’s experience tell us about how to build a society that sees opportunities in the turning and changing times? As islanders, we continue to grapple with experiences of racism, colonialism, environmental damage, and the costs of modernization, and bring to this our own striking creativity and histories for how to live peacefully and productively together. Steered by the four scholars who edited the previous volumes, The Value of Hawaiʻi 3: Hulihia, the Turning offers multigenerational visions of a Hawaiʻi not defined by the United States. Community leaders, cultural practitioners, artists, educators, and activists share exciting paths forward for the future of Hawaiʻi, on topics such as education, tourism and other economies, elder care, agriculture and food, energy and urban development, the environment, sports, arts and culture, technology, and community life.These visions ask us to recognize what we truly value about our home, and offer a wealth of starting points for critical and productive conversations together in this time of profound and permanent change","subjects":["Quality of life — Hawaii"],"publisherName":"University of Hawaii Press,","publishedDate":"","resourceId":"31469795-fcce-427c-bde6-ebe387898fdf"},{"title":"Spring and ashura","subtitle":"for mixed voices and piano","authors":[{"authorName":"Nobunaga, Takatomi","roleTerm":"creator"},{"authorName":"Miyazawa, Kenji","roleTerm":""}],"lcCallNumber":"","ddCallNumber":"","isbn":"4276544939","abstract":"","subjects":["Choruses, Secular (Mixed voices) with piano"],"publisherName":"Ongaku-No-Tomo","publishedDate":"c2005","resourceId":"5bd93ba8-9504-4c19-b449-489eb39ee350"},{"title":"Takashi Murakami","subtitle":"lineage of eccentrics : a collaboration with Nobuo Tsuji and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston","authors":[{"authorName":"Murakami, Takashi","roleTerm":""},{"authorName":"Morse, Anne Nishimura","roleTerm":""},{"authorName":"Tsuji, Nobuo","roleTerm":"interviewee"},{"authorName":"Museum of Fine Arts, Boston","roleTerm":""}],"lcCallNumber":"N7359.M87 A4 2018","ddCallNumber":"700.411","isbn":"9780878468492","abstract":"Takashi Murakami's irreverent, pop culture-infused art has made him one of the most recognized Japanese artists today.

In 1961 Mishima asked Eikoh Hosoe to photograph him, giving him full artistic direction in making these surreal and alluring photographs.

By elaborating on these and several other related poems, Kawabata presents his idea of the gentle and quiet yet warm and passionate quality of the Japanese spirit, one which considers nature a close companion and at times identical with the human self. Moving nimbly through the various traditional Japanese arts, covering flower-arranging, tea ceremony, ceramics, landscaping, and literature, he paints the Japanese idea of beauty in comprehensive and evocative colors, speaking about such things as mono no aware, the poignant awareness of the beauty of things and their passing; the use of plain words in poetry to evoke the wordless; and, very importantly to his own work, the embrace of a nothingness which is quite unlike its Western counterpart in that it has much more to do with becoming one with the world instead of pessimism","subjects":["Aesthetics, Japanese","Japanese prose literature — 1868-"],"publisherName":"Kodansha International","publishedDate":"","resourceId":"d4a6cddd-8ba8-47fc-a7d3-785dfeee4d3c"},{"title":"Glimpses of the changing world","subtitle":"a critique of Yama no oto","authors":[{"authorName":"Kaiser, Emily J","roleTerm":"creator"}],"lcCallNumber":"","ddCallNumber":"","isbn":"","abstract":"","subjects":["Criticism and interpretation"],"publisherName":"","publishedDate":"1963","resourceId":"9a72ad5e-af24-4f1a-a75f-387348f65bc0"},{"title":"The house of the sleeping beauties and other stories","subtitle":"","authors":[{"authorName":"Kawabata, Yasunari","roleTerm":"creator"}],"lcCallNumber":"","ddCallNumber":"","isbn":"4770029756","abstract":"","subjects":["Social life and customs — Fiction — Japan"],"publisherName":"Kodansha International","publishedDate":"2004, c1969","resourceId":"32df3505-7ff2-4960-a937-8f30b8a0d780"},{"title":"The Scarlet gang of Asakusa","subtitle":"","authors":[{"authorName":"Kawabata, Yasunari","roleTerm":"creator"},{"authorName":"Freedman, Alisa","roleTerm":""},{"authorName":"Richie, Donald","roleTerm":""},{"authorName":"Ōta, Samurō","roleTerm":""},{"authorName":"Richie, Donald","roleTerm":""}],"lcCallNumber":"PL832.A9 A8913 2005","ddCallNumber":"895.6/344","isbn":"0520241819 (cloth : alk. paper)","abstract":"A new translation of the only work not currently available in English by a Nobel-Prize winning author and the best known Japanese writer outside of Japan","subjects":["History — Fiction — Tokyo (Japan)"],"publisherName":"University of California Press","publishedDate":"c2005","resourceId":"7d64b6b5-181c-4b8e-ad4d-a6a2b7de53df"},{"title":"Yamato shi uruwashi","subtitle":"Kawabata Yasunari to Yasuda Yukihiko, Ryōkan seitan nihyaku gojūnen, Kawabata seitan hyakujūnen","authors":[{"authorName":"Kawabata, Kaori","roleTerm":""},{"authorName":"Yasuda, Kenʼichi","roleTerm":""},{"authorName":"Mizuhara, Sonohiro","roleTerm":""},{"authorName":"Kaneko, Naoki","roleTerm":""},{"authorName":"Miho Museum","roleTerm":""}],"lcCallNumber":"PL723 .Y36 2008","ddCallNumber":"","isbn":"","abstract":"","subjects":["Art, Japanese"],"publisherName":"Kyūryūsha","publishedDate":"2008","resourceId":"c83373a9-3d1d-4f9a-9b25-d29d3e4ef7be"},{"title":"Lost in evolution","subtitle":"exploring humanity's path in Asia","authors":[{"authorName":"Kawabata, Hiroto","roleTerm":""},{"authorName":"Kaifu, Yōsuke","roleTerm":"contributor"},{"authorName":"Lewis, Dana","roleTerm":"translator"}],"lcCallNumber":"GN281 .K37813 2020","ddCallNumber":"599.938","isbn":"9784866581330","abstract":"","subjects":["Fossil hominids — Asia","Human beings — Origin","Fossil hominids"],"publisherName":"Japan Publishing Industry Foundation for Culture (JPIC)","publishedDate":"2020","resourceId":"b80e8862-5fb8-477e-92e8-8df898ad6494"},{"title":"Kawabata Ryūshi vs. Takahashi Ryūtarō Korekushon","subtitle":"Aida Makoto, Kōnoike Tomoko, Tenmyōya Hisashi, Yamaguchi Akira","authors":[{"authorName":"Kimura, Takuya","roleTerm":"editor"},{"authorName":"Takahashi, Ryūtarō","roleTerm":"current owner"},{"authorName":"Ōta Kuritsu Ryūshi Kinenkan","roleTerm":"host institution"}],"lcCallNumber":"ND1055 .K39 2021","ddCallNumber":"","isbn":"9784763021267","abstract":"","subjects":["Painting, Japanese — Exhibitions — 20th century","Painting, Japanese — Exhibitions — 21st century","Painting, Japanese"],"publisherName":"Kyūryūdō","publishedDate":"2021","resourceId":"328541ed-42f6-43a0-b861-d8e5a39688ca"},{"title":"Murakami Saburō","subtitle":"Murakami Saburō : through the '70s","authors":[{"authorName":"Murakami, Saburō","roleTerm":""}],"lcCallNumber":"N7359.M82 M87 2013","ddCallNumber":"700.411","isbn":"9784861523847","abstract":"Published in conjunction with an exhibition at ARTCOURT Gallery in Osaka, this broad survey explores the expression and diverse changes through the career of this central member of the Gutai Art Association.

Translated by Robert D. Eldridge, for the first time the memoirs of Miyazawa Kiichi will reach a global audience. This book is a critical link to understanding the views and reactions of the Japanese government to globalization after World War II, both under occupation and later as an independent nation, during which time the young, talented, and international-minded Miyazawa played a central role. A firm believer in the \"Yoshida Doctrine,\" Miyazawa argued that Japan should play a civilian economic role instead of becoming a military power in order to satisfy its ego, a position that set him apart from his contemporaries. In this book Miyazawa offers valuable insight into the bilateral relationship that has evolved between Japan and the United States as he describes in detail the many events, personalities, and ideas he came across during his years serving as then-Finance Minister Ikeda Hayato's secretary and in his own work in the Upper House. Secret Talks between Tokyo and Washington is an enlightening text that will appeal to those interested in Asian studies and international relations.\"--BOOK JACKET","subjects":["Foreign relations —","Foreign relations — Japan — 1945-1989","History — Japan — Allied occupation, 1945-1952"],"publisherName":"Lexington Books","publishedDate":"c2007","resourceId":"ebffe715-5d08-408e-8b92-7a610cf898e4"},{"title":"Miyazawa Kenji and his illustrators","subtitle":"images of nature and Buddhism in Japanese children's literature","authors":[{"authorName":"Kilpatrick, Helen","roleTerm":"creator"}],"lcCallNumber":"PL833.I95 Z6947 2013","ddCallNumber":"895.6/344","isbn":"9789004243071 (cloth with dustjacket : alk. paper)","abstract":"","subjects":["Criticism and interpretation","Illustrations","Illustration of books — Japan — 20th century","Children's literature, Japanese — Illustrations","Nature in literature","Buddhism in literature"],"publisherName":"Brill","publishedDate":"2013","resourceId":"8723346c-1ffb-4ea8-bd82-40fc680a5940"},{"title":"The journal of S.

Kazu is the proprietor of a Setsugoan, an After-Snow-Retreat, where she is in the habit of entertaining the high-and-the-mighty of Japan. One day after a banquet, Tamaki, former ambassador to Germany, collapses in the toilet. The subsequent hullabaloo manages to throw Noguchi and Kazu together, and this gentleman of sixty and woman of fifty find themselves falling head-over-heels in love like teenagers. They become man and wife, and soon afterwards, Noguchi is chosen to run for office by the Radical Party. What is essentially an ideological fight for him, however, is just a fight for victory for his wife. Her methods, which are not wholly fair and aboveboard, invite Noguchi's wrath and their relationship soon begins to crack.

Render (v.tr.): to submit, as for consideration; to give or make available; to give what is due or owed; to give in return, or retribution; to surrender; to yield. To represent; to perform an interpretation of; to arrange. To express in another language or form; to translate. To deliver or pronounce formally; to cause to become; to reduce, convert, or melt down, by heating. A recovery narrative has a known form: what it was like, what happened, and what it's like today. In a poem, what can be arranged or interpreted with such certainty, by whom, and to what end? What is the relationship of the performance of recovery via a poem to the truth of the experience? Does one deliver the other? Insert into these considerations the experience of traumas. How is trauma converted by post-trauma experiences? What is the retribution of that experience when articulated as poetry? Enter these questions through the dream, with its unrenderable subjects, landscapes, and plots. Where do dreams meet poetry in their spontaneous, opaque, necessary structures? What do such comparisons yield to the waking reader? What can be rendered intelligible in the soup of long-term recovery? With great ferocity and tenderness, Sachiko Murakami's poems encounter such questions, and then melt them down, by heating.\"--","subjects":["Canadian poetry — 21st century","Canadian poetry"],"publisherName":"Arsenal Pulp Press","publishedDate":"","resourceId":"d8aecff5-d428-4dd5-84d5-1fa19f93c223"},{"title":"Bunka hyōshō to shite no Murakami Haruki","subtitle":"sekai no Haruki no yomikata","authors":[{"authorName":"Ishida, Hitoshi","roleTerm":"editor"},{"authorName":"Bechler, Antonin","roleTerm":"editor"}],"lcCallNumber":"PL856.U673 Z55 2020","ddCallNumber":"","isbn":"9784787292513","abstract":"","subjects":["Criticism and interpretation"],"publisherName":"Seikyūsha","publishedDate":"2020","resourceId":"eaab2455-cafd-4a87-8c20-c953e03d3d24"},{"title":"First person singular","subtitle":"stories","authors":[{"authorName":"Murakami, Haruki","roleTerm":""},{"authorName":"Gabriel, Philip","roleTerm":"translator"}],"lcCallNumber":"PL856.U673 A2 2021","ddCallNumber":"895.63/5","isbn":"9780593318072","abstract":"\"A riveting new collection of short stories from the beloved, internationally acclaimed, Haruki Murakami.

As Damian Flanagan says in his new critical introduction \"Kokoro\" is the Soseki novel that has been given most attention by critics and the public in Japan. On one level, a meditation on the changing face of Japanese culture and its attitudes to honour, friendship, love, death, it is also a sly subversion of all of these things. The novel centres around the friendship between the narrator and the man he calls Sensei, who is haunted by mysterious events in his past. As the friendship grows and the narrator gets to know more about the man he so admires he is increasingly intrigued by this hidden history.

His belief in the importance of monogatari is closely linked to his generation's experience of the counter-culture movement in the late1960s and his research on the 1995 Tokyo Sarin Gas Attack caused by the Aum shinrikyo cult, major events in postwar Japan that revealed many people's desire for a stable narrative to interact with and form their identity from.\" --","subjects":["Criticism and interpretation","Storytelling","Narration (Rhetoric)"],"publisherName":"Routledge","publishedDate":"2019","resourceId":"503d469a-27d1-4913-8d1c-efbfd6fe44cb"},{"title":"Murakami Haruki and his early work","subtitle":"the loneliness of the long-distance running artist","authors":[{"authorName":"Mori, Masaki","roleTerm":""},{"authorName":"ProQuest (Firm)","roleTerm":""}],"lcCallNumber":"PL856.U673 Z8155 2021","ddCallNumber":"895.635","isbn":"9781793635983","abstract":"","subjects":["Criticism and interpretation"],"publisherName":"Lexington Books","publishedDate":"","resourceId":"37b942ce-6ea0-442e-863a-60bb4afef042"},{"title":"The Buddhist Poetry of the Great Kamo Priestess","subtitle":"Daisaiin Senshi and Hosshin Wakashu","authors":[{"authorName":"Kamens, Edward","roleTerm":""},{"authorName":"Michigan Publishing (University of Michigan)","roleTerm":"issuing body"},{"authorName":"University of Michigan","roleTerm":""}],"lcCallNumber":"PL789","ddCallNumber":"895.6/114","isbn":"0-472-88002-0","abstract":"","subjects":["Buddhism in literature"],"publisherName":"University of Michigan Press","publishedDate":"1991","resourceId":"514573b4-7032-422b-8297-0ad11d6fe189"},{"title":"Gashū, Gojira no sekai","subtitle":"The world of Godzilla = Gesila de shi jie","authors":[{"authorName":"Murakami, Yūji","roleTerm":""}],"lcCallNumber":"ND1059.M8258 A4 2022","ddCallNumber":"","isbn":"9784763022011","abstract":"","subjects":["Painting, Japanese — 21st century"],"publisherName":"Kyūryūdō","publishedDate":"2022","resourceId":"39392d48-bafa-4bab-95e3-e0378cc98748"},{"title":"Japan's direct investment to ASEAN countries","subtitle":"","authors":[{"authorName":"Katano, Hikoji","roleTerm":"creator"},{"authorName":"Murakami, Atsushi","roleTerm":"joint author"},{"authorName":"Ikemoto, Kiyoshi","roleTerm":"joint author"},{"authorName":"Murakami, Atsushi","roleTerm":"author"},{"authorName":"Ikemoto, Kiyoshi","roleTerm":"author"},{"authorName":"Kōbe Daigaku","roleTerm":""}],"lcCallNumber":"HG5740.8.A3 K37","ddCallNumber":"","isbn":"","abstract":"","subjects":["Investments, Japanese — Southeast Asia","Economic assistance — Southeast Asia","Foreign economic relations — Southeast Asia"],"publisherName":"Research Institute for Economics & Business Administration, Kobe University","publishedDate":"c1978","resourceId":"1a4c0b7a-2695-4f44-be08-7b94aca63a95"},{"title":"A wild sheep chase","subtitle":"a novel","authors":[{"authorName":"Murakami, Haruki","roleTerm":"creator"}],"lcCallNumber":"PL856.U673 H5713 1989","ddCallNumber":"895.6/35","isbn":"0870119052 (U.S.)","abstract":"It begins simply enough: A twenty-something advertising executive receives a postcard from a friend, and casually appropriates the image for an insurance company's advertisement.

Memories and dreams in turn conjure their magical counterparts--people without names or pasts, fantastic animals, half-animals, and talking machines that traverse the dark psychic underworld of this writer's extraordinary fiction. Fervently acclaimed worldwide, Murakami's wildly imaginative work in many ways remains a mystery, its worlds within worlds uncharted territory. Finally in this book readers will find a map to the strange realm that grounds virtually every aspect of Murakami's writing. A journey through the enigmatic and baffling innermost mind, a metaphysical dimension where Murakami's most bizarre scenes and characters lurk, The Forbidden Worlds of Haruki Murakami exposes the psychological and mythological underpinnings of this other world. Matthew Carl Strecher shows how these considerations color Murakami's depictions of the individual and collective soul, which constantly shift between the tangible and intangible but in this literary landscape are undeniably real. Through these otherworldly depths The Forbidden Worlds of Haruki Murakami also charts the writer's vivid \"inner world,\" whether unconscious or underworld (what some Japanese critics call achiragawa, or \"over there\"), and its connectivity to language. Strecher covers all of Murakami's work--including his efforts as a literary journalist--and concludes with the first full-length close reading of the writer's newest novel, Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki and His Years of Pilgrimage. \"--","subjects":["Criticism and interpretation"],"publisherName":"University of Minnesota Press","publishedDate":"","resourceId":"8a580975-ce3c-4e1f-b91b-12ac1015754b"},{"title":"Furanī to Zūi","subtitle":"","authors":[{"authorName":"Salinger, J.

In this first deconstructive reading of a modern Japanese novelist, Alan Wolfe draws on contemporary Western literary and cultural theories and on a knowledge of Dazai's work in the context of Japanese literary history to provide a fresh view of major texts by this important literary figure. In the process, Wolfe revises Japanese as well as Western scholarship on Dazai and discovers new connections among suicide, autobiography, alienation, and modernization. As shown here, Dazai's writings resist narrative and historical closure; while he may be said to serve the Japanese literary establishment as both romantic decadent and representative scapegoat, his texts reveal a deconstructive edge through which his posthumous status as a monument of negativity is already perceived and undone. Wolfe maintains that cultural modernization pits a Western concept of the individual as realized self and coherent subject against an Eastern absent self--and that a felt need to overcome this tension inspires the autobiographical fiction so prevalent in Japanese novels. Suicidal Narrative in Modern Japan shows that Dazai's texts also resist readings that would resolve the gaps (East/West, self/other, modern/premodern) still prevalent in Japanese intellectual life.Originally published in 1990.The Princeton Legacy Library uses the latest print-on-demand technology to again make available previously out-of-print books from the distinguished backlist of Princeton University Press.

Examining sexual perversion in Tanizaki's aesthetic essays, cultural criticism, cinema writings, and short novels from the 1930s, it argues that Tanizaki understands human subjectivity in remarkably Freudian terms, but that he is much more critical than Freud about what this means for the possibility of love. Author Margherita Long takes readers with her on her personal search for a meaningful feminist approach to Tanizaki's work, and makes the case that perversion in his writings always turns out to involve not the proliferation of interesting gender positions but rather the tragic absence of even two sexes, since femininity is only ever defined as man's absence, supplement. or complement.\" \"In these pages, Long reads Tanizaki with the theoretical complexity he deserves but has seldom received in either Japanese or English. By showing how Tanizaki addressed questions of modernity that are in no way specific to Japan or Japanese literature, Long's work is intended to draw a crossover readership from, and spark conversation between, feminist theory and Japanese literature. Although recent feminist work in Japanese literary and cultural studies is resolutely historicist and focused on gender, Long critiques these two paradigms. By offering a compelling account of the losing side in the current feminist debate in both North America and Japan about how far the \"gender\" paradigm can take us, This Perversion Called Love should stir up controversial exchanges among veteran scholars and inspire a new generation of feminist scholarship in critical Asian studies.\"--BOOK JACKET","subjects":["Criticism and interpretation","Feminist literary criticism — Japan","Psychoanalysis and literature — Japan"],"publisherName":"Stanford University Press","publishedDate":"c2009","resourceId":"e41a32de-dfef-4003-9c68-53a7de7f72eb"},{"title":"The grand old man and the great tradition","subtitle":"essays on Tanizaki Jun'ichiro in honor of Adriana Boscaro","authors":[{"authorName":"Boscaro, Adriana","roleTerm":""},{"authorName":"Bienati, Luisa","roleTerm":""},{"authorName":"Ruperti, Bonaventura","roleTerm":""}],"lcCallNumber":"PL839.A7 Z626 2010","ddCallNumber":"895.6/344","isbn":"9781929280551 (pbk. : alk. paper)","abstract":"","subjects":["Criticism and interpretation"],"publisherName":"Center for Japanese Studies, The University of Michigan","publishedDate":"2010","resourceId":"f158a825-8d51-4717-a30f-b0b6c401ad93"},{"title":"Devils in daylight","subtitle":"","authors":[{"authorName":"Tanizaki, Jun'ichirō","roleTerm":""},{"authorName":"Vincent, Keith","roleTerm":"translator"}],"lcCallNumber":"PL839.A7 H313 2017","ddCallNumber":"895.63/44","isbn":"9780811224918","abstract":"\"One morning, Takahashi, a writer who has just stayed up all night working, is interrupted by a phone call from his old friend Sonomura: barely able to contain his excitement, Sonomura claims that he has cracked a secret cryptographic code based on Edgar Allan Poe's The Gold-Bug and now knows exactly when and where a murder will take place -- and they must hurry if they want to witness the murder, because it's later that very night!

This novel offers a window into Tanizaki's life and work at a critical transition point in his career. The introduction focuses on the moment Tanizaki astounded the literary world in 1928 by writing three novels in the same year, after several years of relative silence following the 1923 Great Kantō Earthquake. Two of the three (Some Prefer Nettles and Quicksand) immediately became famous; this third disappeared from view. The novel tells the story of a writer who in essence kills another writer with his writing. In it, an obsessive paranoid fantasy turns out to invade \"real life,\" and it ends with a man confessing to a murder he did not commit. Over the course of the story, he (the character? the author?) invents a character he calls the \"Shadow Man,\" who is out to entrap the writer (the protagonist? the author?) and destroy him. The tone of the story is comic rather than tragic, sardonic rather than dramatic. There is a peculiar ambiguity between author and character that distinguishes the story from the usual \"I-novel\" genre of the day; the novel is autobiographical in an unusual way, although Tanizaki was never considered an autobiographical writer.

In this series of meditations on seven of Tanizaki's novels and novellas, the renowned translator Anthony Chambers explores the attempt by Tanizaki's characters to construct ideal worlds: fantasies that were far removed from the concerns of everyday life and were, for the most part, unattainable. Chambers focuses on the thread of fantasy that Tanizaki weaves throughout his work; he examines the writer's subtle use of storytelling devices to evoke his characters' alternate sense of reality and encourage the reader's participation in their fantasies. Using his intimate knowledge of Tanizaki's works, Chambers superbly evokes the beauty and truth Tanizaki's characters find in their ideal worlds","subjects":["Criticism and interpretation"],"publisherName":"Council on East Asian Studies, Harvard University","publishedDate":"1994","resourceId":"780fc486-4b63-4a82-ba43-5e5b81ce6db3"},{"title":"Some prefer nettles","subtitle":"","authors":[{"authorName":"Tanizaki, Jun'ichirō","roleTerm":"creator"}],"lcCallNumber":"","ddCallNumber":"","isbn":"","abstract":"","subjects":[[]],"publisherName":"Tuttle","publishedDate":"","resourceId":"6645ba13-95d6-475e-86d0-245ac70a6720"},{"title":"The Makioka sisters","subtitle":"","authors":[{"authorName":"Tanizaki, Jun'ichirō","roleTerm":"creator"}],"lcCallNumber":"PL839.A7 S3713 1964","ddCallNumber":"","isbn":"","abstract":"","subjects":[],"publisherName":"A.

Determined to transform her into the perfect wife and to whisk her away from the seamy underbelly of post-World War I Tokyo, Joji adopts and ultimately marries Naomi, paying for English and music lessons that promise to mold her into his ideal companion.

Made accessible in English by the expertise of translators Anthony H. Chambers and Paul McCarthy, the stories in The Gourmet Club vividly explore an array of human passions. In \"The Children,\" three mischievous friends play sadomasochistic games in a mysterious Western-style mansion. The sybaritic narrator of \"The Secret\" experiments with cross-dressing as he savors the delights of duplicity. \"The Two Acolytes\" evokes the conflicting attractions of spiritual fulfillment and worldly pleasure in medieval Kyoto. In the title story, the seductive tastes, aromas, and textures of outlandish Chinese dishes blend with those of the seductive hands that proffer them to blindfolded gourmets. In \"Mr. Bluemound,\" Tanizaki, who wrote for a film studio in the early 1920s, considers the relationship between a flesh-and-blood actress and her image fixed on celluloid, which one memorably degenerate admirer is obsessed with. And, finally, \"Manganese Dioxide Dreams\" offers a tantalizing insight into the author's mind as he weaves together the musings of an old man very like Tanizaki himself-Chinese and Japanese cuisine, a French murder movie, Chinese history, and the contents of a toilet bowl.

The writer Mizuno has penned a story about the perfect murder. His fictional victim is modeled on an acquaintance, a fellow writer. When Mizuno notices just before the story is about to be published that this man’s real name has crept into his manuscript, he attempts to correct the mistake, but it is too late. He then becomes terrified that an actual murder will take place—and that he will be the main suspect. Mizuno goes to great lengths to establish an alibi, venturing into the city's underworld. But he finds himself only more entangled as his paranoid fantasies, including a mysterious \"Shadow Man\" out to entrap him, intrude into real life. A sophisticated psychological and metafictional mystery, In Black and White is a masterful yet little-known novel from a great writer at the height of his powers.The year 1928 was a remarkable one for Tanizaki. He wrote three exquisite novels, but while two of them—Some Prefer Nettles and Quicksand—became famous, In Black and White disappeared from view. All three were serialized in Osaka and Tokyo newspapers and magazines, but In Black and White was never published as an independent volume.

Yet Christianity is ubiquitous in Japanese popular culture. From the giant mutant \"angels\" of the Neon Genesis Evangelion franchise to the Jesus-themed cocktails enjoyed by customers in Tokyo's Christon café, Japanese popular culture appropriates Christianity in both humorous and unsettling ways. By treating the Western religion as an exotic cultural practice, Japanese demonstrate the reversibility of cultural stereotypes and force us to reconsider common views of global cultural flows and East-West relations.Of particular interest is the repeated reappearance in modern fiction of the so-called \"Christian century\" of Japan (1549-1638), the period between the arrival of the Jesuit missionaries and the last Christian revolt before the final ban on the foreign religion. Literary authors as different as Akutagawa Ryūnosuke, Endō Shūsaku, Yamada Fūtarō, and Takemoto Novala, as well as film directors, manga and anime authors, and videogame producers have all expressed their fascination with the lives and works of Catholic missionaries and Japanese converts and produced imaginative reinterpretations of the period. In Holy Ghosts, Rebecca Suter explores the reasons behind the popularity of the Christian century in modern Japanese fiction and reflects on the role of cross-cultural representations in Japan. Since the opening of the ports in the Meiji period, Japan's relationship with Euro-American culture has oscillated between a drive towards Westernization and an antithetical urge to \"return to Asia.\" Exploring the twentieth-century's fascination with the Christian Century enables Suter to reflect on modern Japan's complex combination of Orientalism, self-Orientalism, and Occidentalism. By looking back at a time when the Japanese interacted with Europeans in ways that were both similar to and different from modern dealings, fictional representations of the Christian century offer an opportunity to reflect critically not only on cross-cultural negotiation but also more broadly on both Japanese and Western social and political formations. The ghosts of the Christian century that haunt modern Japanese fiction thus prompt us to rethink conventional notions of East-West exchanges, mutual representations, and power relations, complicating our understanding of global modernity","subjects":["In literature","Criticism and interpretation","Christianity in literature","Japanese fiction — History and criticism — 20th century"],"publisherName":"University of Hawaii Press,","publishedDate":"","resourceId":"a6553931-0843-45ce-a94e-30cc2dcaacff"},{"title":"Akasen chitai","subtitle":"","authors":[{"authorName":"Sugawara, Kenji","roleTerm":""},{"authorName":"Nagata, Masaichi","roleTerm":""},{"authorName":"Narusawa, Masashige","roleTerm":""},{"authorName":"Mizoguchi, Kenji","roleTerm":""},{"authorName":"Kyō, Machiko","roleTerm":""},{"authorName":"Wakao, Ayako","roleTerm":""},{"authorName":"Kogure, Michiyo","roleTerm":""},{"authorName":"Kawakami, Yasuko","roleTerm":""},{"authorName":"Mimasu, Aiko","roleTerm":""},{"authorName":"Daiē, Kabushiki Kaisha","roleTerm":""},{"authorName":"Janus Films","roleTerm":""},{"authorName":"Criterion Collection (Firm)","roleTerm":""}],"lcCallNumber":"PN1997 .A3974 2008","ddCallNumber":"","isbn":"9781604650990","abstract":"The final film of director Kenji Mizoguchi follows the lives of five prostitutes in the Yoshiwara region of Tokyo.

However, practice remains rooted in values fostered in traditional Japanese culture and in civil law systems on which Japan's pre-war legal system was based. This results in, by Anglo-American standards, a somewhat stunted set of adversary practices. Nowhere in Japan is this tension more clearly revealed than in its criminal justice system. The contributions to this book, by noted American and Japanese scholars, explore key institution practices and controversies in the Japanese criminal process in the light of this tension. This is a lively and informative analysis of the major controversies surrounding the Japanese adversary process, which will be of interest to students and scholars of comparative law and politics.\"--BOOK JACKET","subjects":["Adversary system (Law) — Japan","Criminal procedure — Japan"],"publisherName":"Palgrave Macmillan","publishedDate":"2002","resourceId":"f09b36b6-113c-42ca-9950-c7f3645710f2"},{"title":"Der Umgang mit Kriegs- und Besatzungsunrecht in Japan und Deutschland","subtitle":"","authors":[{"authorName":"Marxen, Klaus","roleTerm":""},{"authorName":"Miyazawa, Kōichi","roleTerm":""},{"authorName":"Werle, Gerhard","roleTerm":""}],"lcCallNumber":"K5301.A6 U44x 2001","ddCallNumber":"","isbn":"3830502516","abstract":"","subjects":["War crimes — Japan","War crimes — Germany","World War, 1939-1945 — Atrocities — Japan","World War, 1939-1945 — Atrocities — Germany","War crime trials — Japan","War crime trials — Germany","World War, 1939-1945 — Claims — Japan"],"publisherName":"Berlin Verlag A.

The signaling pathway of TGF-β now is rather well understood. Continuing revelations in the mechanisms of action of TGF-β provide specific mechanistic examples of how human cells lose their controlled function and behave wrongly during the development of diverse diseases. Equally important, however, is the current promise of exploiting the TGF-β pathway in combating human disease. This book comprehensively covers major areas of human disease where the involvement of TGF-β is firmly established. Simultaneously, the book highlights major gaps in knowledge and the future directions of research that can benefit human medical science. The core set of diseases where TGF-β action is well documented and are included in the book are cancer and cardiovascular and fibrotic disorders. The central aim of the book is to stimulate young scientists to enter the prolific TGF-β field and find new solutions to the problems remaining in this area of study. For this purpose the book provides authoritative educational chapters that furnish a good introduction to the field for young doctoral students, postdocs, and clinical fellows. The book also serves as a valuable reference for the aficionados in the field, who can find accessible and well-illustrated material for their teaching and lecturing activities, via which the importance of TGF-β biology is disseminated to the world of science and to the public","subjects":["Transforming growth factors-beta","Cytokines — Pathophysiology"],"publisherName":"Springer","publishedDate":"c2013","resourceId":"5fc08f08-3eb3-4441-9dde-394c596fbe96"},{"title":"Journal of S.

It highlights similarities between the practice of criminology research in Japan, as well as important differences, with other areas of Asia and with the West. In previous decades, Japan attracted international attention as the only industrialized country where the crime rate declined along with a rise in urbanization and economic development. Currently, Japan still enjoys a declining crime rate (the lowest among major industrialized countries) and a study of criminal justice practices in Japan may provide important insights for other regions. Japan also experiences important contemporary challenges which are shared by other regions: 1. Japan has the highest proportion of people over the age of 60 in the world. For criminology, this means key challenges in the victimization of older people, as well as the challenges of an aging prison population. 2. Besides the United States, Japan is the only developed country that still practices capital punishment, and its rate has been on the rise in the past 20 years. 3. Japan has also introduced new reforms in its law practice, including the introduction of new trial formats. The research in this book provides a helpful overview for scholars interested in criminology and criminal justice in Japan to understand the key issues of concern, and present a framework for future research needs. It will be of interest to researchers in criminology and criminal justice, international studies, Asian Studies, sociology, and political science","subjects":["Criminology","Law — Asia","Comparative

In the late nineteenth century, some Buddhist thinkers sought to reinterpret the Pure Land in ways that would allow it speak to modern Japan. Their efforts succeeded in ways they could not have predicted. During the war years, economist Kawakami Hajime, philosopher Miki Kiyoshi, and historian Ienaga Saburō-left-leaning thinkers with no special training in doctrinal studies and no strong connection to any Buddhist institution-seized upon modernized images of Shinran in exile and a transcendent Western Paradise to resist the demands of a state that was bearing down on its citizens with increasing force. Pure Land, Real World treats the religious thought of these three major figures in English for the first time.Kawakami turned to religion after being imprisoned for his involvement with the Japanese Communist Party, borrowing the Shinshū image of the two truths to assert that Buddhist law and Marxist social science should reinforce each other, like the two wings of a bird. Miki, a member of the Kyoto School who went from prison to the crown prince's think tank and back again, identified Shinran's religion as belonging to the proletariat: For him, following Shinran and working toward building a buddha land on earth were akin to realizing social revolution. And Ienaga's understanding of the Pure Land-as the crystallization of a logic of negation that undermined every real power structure-fueled his battle against the state censorship system, just as he believed it had enabled Shinran to confront the world's suffering head on. Such readings of the Pure Land tradition are idiosyncratic-perhaps even heretical-but they hum with the same vibrancy that characterized medieval Pure Land belief. Innovative and refreshingly accessible, Pure Land, Real World shows that the Pure Land tradition informed twentieth-century Japanese thought in profound and surprising ways and suggests that it might do the same for twenty-first-century thinkers. The critical power of Pure Land utopianism has yet to be exhausted","subjects":["Pure Land Buddhism — History — Japan","Buddhism and politics — History — Japan","Utopias — Religious aspects — Buddhism"],"publisherName":"University of Hawaii Press,","publishedDate":"","resourceId":"0b3ae66b-0f7b-4eca-ab28-66314de4c7b9"},{"title":"Seins et œufs","subtitle":"","authors":[{"authorName":"Kawakami, Mieko","roleTerm":""},{"authorName":"Honnoré, Patrick","roleTerm":"translator"}],"lcCallNumber":"PL872.5.A89 C5514 2014","ddCallNumber":"","isbn":"9782330030681","abstract":"","subjects":[[]],"publisherName":"Actes Sud","publishedDate":"mars 2014","resourceId":"cbe354d4-3dfa-4204-99a5-47f84d260b76"},{"title":"Patrick Modiano","subtitle":"","authors":[{"authorName":"Kawakami, Akane","roleTerm":""}],"lcCallNumber":"PQ2673.O3 Z75 2015","ddCallNumber":"843/.914","isbn":"1-78694-523-1","abstract":"Conceived as a second edition to Kawakami's acclaimed A Self-Conscious Art, which was the first full-length study in English of Patrick Modiano's work, this book has been comprehensively updated with two new chapters, notably discussing the author's recent work and his Nobel Prize win.

The narrator, who remains unnamed for most of the story, struggles with her own indeterminable identity of being neither a \"daughter\" nor a \"mother.\" Set over three stiflingly hot days in Tokyo, the book tells of a reunion of sorts between two sisters, and the passage into womanhood of young Midoriko","subjects":["Women — Fiction — Japan","Women — Identity — Fiction","Augmentation mammaplasty — Fiction","Puberty — Fiction","Aging — Psychological aspects — Fiction","Families — Fiction","Aging — Psychological aspects","Augmentation mammaplasty","Families","Puberty","Women","Women — Identity"],"publisherName":"Europa Editions","publishedDate":"2021","resourceId":"25b0bbbb-90e8-4c6c-9ae8-ae4cc19f026f"},{"title":"Heaven","subtitle":"","authors":[{"authorName":"Kawakami, Mieko","roleTerm":""},{"authorName":"Bett, Sam","roleTerm":"translator"},{"authorName":"Boyd, David (David G.)","roleTerm":"translator"}],"lcCallNumber":"PL872.5.A89 H48 2021","ddCallNumber":"[Fic]","isbn":"9781609456214","abstract":"","subjects":["Victims of bullying — Fiction","Bullying — Fiction","Friendship — Fiction","Bullying","Friendship","Teenagers","Victims of bullying"],"publisherName":"Europa Editions","publishedDate":"2021","resourceId":"d1717671-6bb2-4d65-ad5e-fbd0aa6c5507"},{"title":"The Theory of dynamical systems and its applications to nonlinear problems","subtitle":"","authors":[{"authorName":"Kawakami, Hiroshi","roleTerm":""},{"authorName":"Kyōto Daigaku","roleTerm":""}],"lcCallNumber":"QA614.8 .T48 1984","ddCallNumber":"","isbn":"997196693X","abstract":"","subjects":["Differentiable dynamical systems","Topological dynamics","Dynamics","Differentiable dynamical systems — Congresses","Topological dynamics — Congresses","Dynamics — Congresses"],"publisherName":"World Scientific","publishedDate":"c1984","resourceId":"d50b4268-8480-4afe-bbd0-ac536eb35540"},{"title":"Credo","subtitle":"a process perspective","authors":[{"authorName":"Kawakami, Melvyn W","roleTerm":"creator"}],"lcCallNumber":"","ddCallNumber":"","isbn":"","abstract":"","subjects":[[]],"publisherName":"","publishedDate":"1974","resourceId":"e3132f33-336f-4ee0-93aa-3cae78cf581f"},{"title":"Japanese Marxist","subtitle":"a portrait of Kawakami Hajime, 1879-1946","authors":[{"authorName":"Bernstein, Gail Lee","roleTerm":"creator"}],"lcCallNumber":"HX413.8.K39 B47 1990","ddCallNumber":"335.43/092 B","isbn":"0674471946","abstract":"","subjects":["Socialists — Biography — Japan","Economists — Biography — Japan"],"publisherName":"Council on East Asian Studies, Harvard University","publishedDate":"1990, c1976","resourceId":"2c7c7da3-ea30-4e2b-ae9f-4896090f24a1"},{"title":"Manchoukuo","subtitle":"child of conflict","authors":[{"authorName":"Kawakami, Kiyoshi Karl","roleTerm":"creator"}],"lcCallNumber":"","ddCallNumber":"","isbn":"","abstract":"","subjects":[[]],"publisherName":"","publishedDate":"1933","resourceId":"d9bc9f37-baa7-4515-aa40-e6cb20840def"},{"title":"Biological rhythms in neuroendocrine activity","subtitle":"","authors":[{"authorName":"Kawakami, Masazumi","roleTerm":""}],"lcCallNumber":"QP356.4 .B56","ddCallNumber":"","isbn":"","abstract":"","subjects":["Neuroendocrinology","Biological rhythms"],"publisherName":"Igaku Shoin","publishedDate":"1974","resourceId":"ab2723a7-b9c6-42fa-858b-73ada7c19ed3"},{"title":"Hormones and brain development","subtitle":"proceedings of an international symposium held in Berlin, German Democratic Republic on September 6-8, 1978","authors":[{"authorName":"Dörner, G.

This book explores both the benefits and potential problems of deploying a BMD system in Japan. It examines the main policies and actions undertaken thus far by Japan in the area of BMD, discusses several future milestones and likely next steps, and identifies the major Japanese individuals and organizations influencing future decisions on BMD. It also assesses how such issues as alliance maintenance, cost, feasibility, commercial incentives, and Chinese behavior are addressed by key Japanese players. It finds that, to date, Japan has undertaken no effort to develop or acquire a dedicated BMD system nor has it assessed in any thorough or systematic manner the larger political and strategic implications of a BMD system. More importantly, no consensus has yet emerged in favor of the development or deployment of a full-fledged BMD system in Japan. The book concludes that Japan could gradually acquire many of the elements of a BMD system while avoiding an explicit, formal deployment decision. The development or deployment of a complete BMD system with the United States, however, will likely pose many challenges to the U.S.-Japan alliance","subjects":["Ballistic missile defenses — Japan","Ballistic missiles — China","Ballistic missiles — Korea (North)","Defenses — Japan"],"publisherName":"Rand","publishedDate":"2001","resourceId":"06fd5aac-9d0f-4a0f-b692-158ca109b87f"},{"title":"Acting like a woman in modern Japan","subtitle":"theater, gender, and nationalism","authors":[{"authorName":"Kano, Ayako","roleTerm":"creator"}],"lcCallNumber":"PN2928.K375 K36 2001","ddCallNumber":"792/.028/0820952","isbn":"0312292910 (alk. paper)","abstract":"","subjects":["Women in the theater — History — Japan — 19th century","Women in the theater — History — Japan — 20th century"],"publisherName":"Palgrave","publishedDate":"2001","resourceId":"a6947e30-82ca-4892-8f2a-d213571be4bf"},{"title":"Madame Sadayakko","subtitle":"the geisha who bewitched the West","authors":[{"authorName":"Downer, Lesley","roleTerm":"creator"}],"lcCallNumber":"PN2928.K375 D69 2003","ddCallNumber":"792/.028/092 B","isbn":"1592400051 (alk. paper)","abstract":"Presents the story of the geisha whose life inspired Puccini's Madame Butterfly, from her training in geisha traditions to her marriage to penniless actor and political maverick Otojiro Kawakami and her rise to international celebrity","subjects":["Actors — Biography — Japan","Geishas — Biography — Japan"],"publisherName":"Gotham Books","publishedDate":"c2003","resourceId":"06dfa89c-79d5-4589-832e-1c5357cb02db"},{"title":"Reflections on music popularization","subtitle":"","authors":[{"authorName":"Kawakami, Genʼichi","roleTerm":"creator"}],"lcCallNumber":"MT1 .K3 1987","ddCallNumber":"","isbn":"","abstract":"","subjects":["Music — Instruction and study","Popular music — Instruction and study"],"publisherName":"Yamaha Music Foundation","publishedDate":"1987","resourceId":"d184c82b-028b-4cfa-92f3-68dea89509fb"},{"title":"Sono otoko kyōbō ni tsuki","subtitle":"Violent cop","authors":[{"authorName":"Bīto Takeshi","roleTerm":""},{"authorName":"Okuyama, Kazuyoshi","roleTerm":""},{"authorName":"Nozawa, Hisashi","roleTerm":""},{"authorName":"Kishibe, Ittoku","roleTerm":""},{"authorName":"Otonashi, Mikiko","roleTerm":""},{"authorName":"Sano, Shiro","roleTerm":""},{"authorName":"Kawakami, Maiko","roleTerm":""},{"authorName":"Hakuryu","roleTerm":""},{"authorName":"Fox Lorber Home Video (Firm)","roleTerm":""},{"authorName":"Wellspring Media","roleTerm":""}],"lcCallNumber":"PN1997 .S66 2003","ddCallNumber":"","isbn":"1572526203","abstract":"Detective Azuma is a Dirty-Harry style rogue cop who often uses violence and unethical methods to get results.

The entire medical department is restless while preparing for the election to choose a new Surgical Department Professor. All Goro has on his mind, is how to win the election. Meanwhile, Shuji is looking after a patient who apparently has pancreatic cancer. He carries out tests on the patient cautiously, and is very careful in telling the patient of the cancer. However, Goro barges in on their conversation, and out of the blue, tells the patient he has cancer, and that he needs an operation right away. Shuji is furious at Goro's rude attitude, and yells, \"Doctors are not God!\" Goro ignores this, and starts laying the groundwork for the operation. But when Goro finds out that the Director of the Medical Department has already given a diagnosis of stomach cancer, he cancels the operation.

The expansion of foreign direct investment, increase in international trade, and accelerated flow of financial and human resources across country borders have triggered rapid industrialization and economic integration in the region. This volume uses the global value chains (GVC) perspective, to explore how the dynamic interactions between firms from developed and developing economies, together with other factors, have stimulated and shaped the rise of local firm capabilities in East Asia. By extending and modifying the existing GVC perspective, the contributors present their own analytical framework to explain the rise of firm capabilities within value-chain dynamics.

What really made him 'demonic'? In fact, the many perceptions of Paganini as demonic - Faust, magician, devil, rake/libertine, Napoleon - were inter-related but not equivalent. This book investigates the legend of Paganini: separating fact from fiction, it explains how the legendary violinist challenged the very notion of what it meant to be a musician. An understanding of his violin techniques and musical ethos goes some way towards meeting this aim, beyond which an exploration of the wider cultural context is also presented. This book considers Paganini's performance innovations in the light of contemporary attitudes towards music and the supernatural, gender, sexuality, violence, heroism, masculinity, as well conceptions of power. A swirl of cultural factors coalesced in the performer to create that phenomenon of Romanticism, a larger-than- life Gothic villain. Because the mythology surrounding the violinist outlived and outgrew the man to monstrous proportions, so too did the idea of virtuosity inflate out of control, acquiring a potent, overwhelmingly negative aura in the process. An appendix brings together late nineteenth-century British press and literature coverage of Paganini that contributed to the developing myth surrounding the now famous composer and performer.\"--Publisher's description","subjects":["Influence","Violinists — Biography — Italy"],"publisherName":"The Boydell Press","publishedDate":"2013","resourceId":"5f85c30c-10ac-4c70-8389-24e5ba505fe5"},{"title":"Site-selective catalysis","subtitle":"","authors":[{"authorName":"Kawabata, Takeo","roleTerm":"editor"}],"lcCallNumber":"QD505","ddCallNumber":"541/.395","isbn":"9783319263335","abstract":"The series Topics in Current Chemistry presents critical reviews of the present and future trends in modern chemical research.

Each review within the volume critically surveys one aspect of that topic and places it within the context of the volume as a whole. The most significant developments of the last 5 to 10 years are presented using selected examples to illustrate the principles discussed. The coverage is not intended to be an exhaustive summary of the field or include large quantities of data, but should rather be conceptual, concentrating on the methodological thinking that will allow the non-specialist reader to understand the information presented.

It was an act of delayed atonement that paid a debt of honor incurred thirty-five years earlier. The revered military hero's wife joined in his act of junshi (\"following one's lord into death\"). The violence of their double suicide shocked the nation. What had impelled the general and his wife, on the threshold of a new era, to resort so drastically, so dramatically, to this forbidden, anachronistic practice? The nation was divided. There were those who saw the suicides as a heroic affirmation of the samurai code; others found them a cause for embarrassment, a sign that Japan had not yet crossed the cultural line separating tradition from modernity.While acknowledging the nation's sharply divided reaction to the Nogis' junshi as a useful indicator of the event's seismic impact on Japanese culture, Doris G. Bargen in the first half of her book demonstrates that the deeper significance of Nogi's action must be sought in his personal history, enmeshed as it was in the tumultuous politics of the Meiji period. Suicidal Honor traces Nogi's military career (and personal travail) through the armed struggles of the collapsing shôgunate and through the two wars of imperial conquest during which Nogi played a significant role: the Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895) and the Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905). It also probes beneath the political to explore the religious origins of ritual self-sacrifice in cultures as different as ancient Rome and today's Nigeria. Seen in this context, Nogi's death was homage to the divine emperor. But what was the significance of Nogi's waiting thirty-five years before he offered himself as a human sacrifice to a dead rather than living deity? To answer this question, Bargen delves deeply and with great insight into the story of Nogi's conflicted career as a military hero who longed to be a peaceful man of letters. In the second half of Suicidal Honor Bargen turns to the extraordinary influence of the Nogis' deaths on two of Japan's greatest writers, Mori Ôgai and Natsume Sôseki. Ôgai's historical fiction, written in the immediate aftermath of his friend's junshi, is a profound meditation on the significance of ritual suicide in a time of historical transition. Stories such as \"The Sakai Incident\" (\"Sakai jiken\") appear in a new light and with greatly enhanced resonance in Bargen's interpretation. In Sôseki's masterpiece, Kokoro, Sensei, the protagonist, refers to the emperor's death and his general's junshi before taking his own life. Scholars routinely mention these references, but Bargen demonstrates convincingly the uncanny ways in which Sôseki's agonized response to Nogi's suicide structures the entire novel. By exploring the historical and literary legacies of Nogi, Ôgai, and Sôseki from an interdisciplinary perspective, Suicidal Honor illuminates Japan's prolonged and painful transition from the idealized heroic world of samurai culture to the mundane anxieties of modernity. It is a study that will fascinate specialists in the fields of Japanese literature, history, and religion, and anyone seeking a deeper understanding of Japan's warrior culture","subjects":["Criticism and interpretation","In literature","Japanese literature — History and criticism — 1868-","Suicide in literature","Seppuku"],"publisherName":"University of Hawaii Press,","publishedDate":"","resourceId":"450d128f-b836-4517-8717-17c85abd9d5c"},{"title":"Thirst for love","subtitle":"","authors":[{"authorName":"Mishima, Yukio","roleTerm":"creator"}],"lcCallNumber":"PL833.I7 A713 1980","ddCallNumber":"895.6/35","isbn":"039950494X","abstract":"","subjects":[[]],"publisherName":"Perigee Books","publishedDate":"[1980] c1969","resourceId":"f7a30ea7-e0e7-4883-9d4f-afd2e42b4ae2"},{"title":"The sailor who fell from grace with the sea","subtitle":"","authors":[{"authorName":"Mishima, Yukio","roleTerm":"creator"}],"lcCallNumber":"PZ4.M6675 Sai","ddCallNumber":"","isbn":"","abstract":"","subjects":[[]],"publisherName":"Knopf","publishedDate":"1965","resourceId":"559418d7-d73c-40eb-8438-67971ca7110e"},{"title":"The sea of fertility","subtitle":"containing Spring snow, Runaway horses, The temple of dawn, [and] The decay of the angel","authors":[{"authorName":"Mishima, Yukio","roleTerm":"creator"}],"lcCallNumber":"","ddCallNumber":"","isbn":"0436281600","abstract":"","subjects":[[]],"publisherName":"Secker & Warburg","publishedDate":"1985","resourceId":"7f2a497a-3f1b-4713-823c-e89317ec9b9e"},{"title":"Mishima","subtitle":"a vision of the void","authors":[{"authorName":"Yourcenar, Marguerite","roleTerm":"creator"}],"lcCallNumber":"PL833.I7 Z98713 1986","ddCallNumber":"895.6/35 B","isbn":"0374210330","abstract":"","subjects":["Authors, Japanese — Biography — 20th century"],"publisherName":"A.

Yet in 1970 Mishima shocked the world with a bizarre attempt at a coup d'etat, which ended in his suicide by ritual disembowelment. In his radically new analysis of an extraordinary life, Damian Flanagan moves away from the stereotypical depiction of Mishima as a right-wing nationalist and aesthete and presents him as a man utterly obsessed with time - time-keeping devices and symbols - arguing that this compulsion was at the heart of the author's literature and life. This book untangles the frequent distortions in the writer's memoirs, which have often been taken at face value, and traces the evolution of Mishima's attempts to master and transform both his sexuality and artistic persona.Though often perceived as a solitary protest figure, this book shows how Mishima was very much in tune with post-war culture: taking up bodybuilding and becoming a model and actor in the 1950s; adopting the themes of contemporary political scandals in his work; courting English translators and even becoming influenced by the student protests and hippy subculture of the late 1960s. Yet while being in thrall to the modern world, the flip side of Mishima's personality - his hidden neuroses and the traumas of his youth - continually pushed him towards a firm rejection of modern Japan and his explosive final act of self-annihilation","subjects":["Authors, Japanese — Biography — 20th century"],"publisherName":"Reaktion Books","publishedDate":"2014","resourceId":"d8534dce-df62-40a4-94fb-e298d132fe0f"},{"title":"Yukio Mishima","subtitle":"","authors":[],"lcCallNumber":"PL833.I7","ddCallNumber":"","isbn":"1-4298-1518-3","abstract":"","subjects":[],"publisherName":"Great Neck Publishing","publishedDate":"2005","resourceId":"f09810c5-4cad-459e-b100-ec8be1a32101"},{"title":"Show me the mini","subtitle":"guide book","authors":[{"authorName":"Steuber, Jason","roleTerm":"curator"},{"authorName":"Peyton, Allysa B","roleTerm":"curator"},{"authorName":"Mishima, Kimiyo","roleTerm":"artist"},{"authorName":"Ufan, Lee","roleTerm":"artist"},{"authorName":"Shibata, Zeshin","roleTerm":"artist"},{"authorName":"Park, Junebum","roleTerm":"artist"},{"authorName":"Sadao, Nozaki","roleTerm":"artist"},{"authorName":"Yuen, Seng","roleTerm":"artist"},{"authorName":"A-Cheong","roleTerm":"artist"},{"authorName":"Ono, Hakuko","roleTerm":"artist"},{"authorName":"Kazuo, Yagi","roleTerm":"artist"},{"authorName":"Roy, Jamini","roleTerm":"artist"},{"authorName":"Samuel P.

Issues of size, scale, modeling, ownership, production, and historical and contemporary functions of miniatures will be examined. Questions that will be addressed include: How do views and inquiries of the artist, scientist, and designer benefit from comparisons and contrasts of a miniaturization of a work? What are perspective and scale in the arts? How do we define how we see things? This exhibition, which is drawn from the Harn's permanent collection of Asian art, highlights an overlooked theme in Asian art and presents a unique opportunity to remind viewers that art comes in all shapes and sizes. It also illuminates the investigation by our collective via constant inquiries into size, scale, modeling, technique, means/opportunities, and intellectual and theoretic growth. Why Mini? Why Now? Miniature artworks on display in museums often are overshadowed by monumental works. Show Me the Mini is organized to remind us that we are surrounded by that which is small and tiny, and that our languages reflect this reality. We encounter \"mini\" automobiles, microwave \"mini\" snacks, and endure micro-derm abrasion therapies to alter the way we look. Cutting edge research and technologies, such as those being developed by our University of Florida exhibition partner, Nanoscience Institute for Medical and Engineering Technology (NIMET), allow tiny technological devices to improve healthcare and better our understanding of the seen and unseen worlds around us.

It is a critical examination of a split that runs deep in the discursive space of Soseki's writings as order (narrative control and form) grapples with the forces of chaos (existential loneliness and unfathomable fear). Displaying a profound appreciation for the key attributes and complex cultural significance of Soseki's work, Angela Yiu argues that, although Soseki by nature and temperament desired control and order, his writing betrays a dark, romantic voice that speaks of something cavernous and amorphous. Chaos and Order examines the way Soseki reinterprets existing literary forms and formulates a language to express the duality within him.\"--BOOK JACKET. \"The Introduction, which contains a survey of current Soseki studies in Japan, will be an especially valuable reference for students of Japanese literature.\"--BOOK JACKET","subjects":["Criticism and interpretation"],"publisherName":"University of Hawai'i Press","publishedDate":"1998","resourceId":"bcf434d6-ed52-4fe2-8b06-0dcc1f9e2045"},{"title":"Rereading Sōseki","subtitle":"three early twentieth-century Japanese novels","authors":[{"authorName":"Auestad, Reiko Abe","roleTerm":"creator"}],"lcCallNumber":"PL812.A8 Z5664 1998","ddCallNumber":"","isbn":"3447041226 (pbk.)","abstract":"","subjects":["Criticism and interpretation"],"publisherName":"Harrassowitz","publishedDate":"1998","resourceId":"e3272e45-9058-45ee-b2b2-f894d85146e4"},{"title":"A critical study of the novels of Natsume Sōseki, 1867-1916","subtitle":"","authors":[{"authorName":"Ridgeway, William N","roleTerm":"creator"}],"lcCallNumber":"PL812.A8 Z83415 2004","ddCallNumber":"895.6/342","isbn":"0773462309","abstract":"","subjects":["Criticism and interpretation"],"publisherName":"Edwin Mellen Press","publishedDate":"c2004","resourceId":"f1f01f53-7081-4bde-a9f3-44b44391e65e"},{"title":"To the spring equinox and beyond","subtitle":"","authors":[{"authorName":"Natsume, Sōseki","roleTerm":"creator"},{"authorName":"Ochiai, Kingo","roleTerm":""},{"authorName":"Goldstein, Sanford","roleTerm":""}],"lcCallNumber":"PL812.A8 H513 2005","ddCallNumber":"","isbn":"4805307412","abstract":"","subjects":[],"publisherName":"Tuttle","publishedDate":"","resourceId":"9ae2da2d-ebcc-45bb-89f1-a82b28045131"},{"title":"Botchan","subtitle":"","authors":[{"authorName":"Natsume, Sōseki","roleTerm":"creator"}],"lcCallNumber":"","ddCallNumber":"895.6342","isbn":"0804837031 (pbk.)","abstract":"","subjects":[[]],"publisherName":"Tuttle","publishedDate":"2005","resourceId":"6acbf6b1-325c-450d-9491-f6fb3a7598a5"},{"title":"Sōseki no seorī","subtitle":"\"bungakuron\" kaidoku","authors":[{"authorName":"Satō, Yūko","roleTerm":"creator"}],"lcCallNumber":"PL812.A8 Z8346 2005","ddCallNumber":"","isbn":"4273033941","abstract":"","subjects":["Criticism and interpretation"],"publisherName":"Ōfū","publishedDate":"2005","resourceId":"68e9e03a-400d-441f-9a4b-99983d7490ac"},{"title":"The gate","subtitle":"","authors":[{"authorName":"Natsume, Sōseki","roleTerm":"creator"}],"lcCallNumber":"PL812.A8 M613 2006","ddCallNumber":"895.634","isbn":"0720612500 (pbk.)","abstract":"","subjects":["Social conditions — Fiction — Japan"],"publisherName":"Peter Owen","publishedDate":"c2006","resourceId":"9ee7c591-75f1-4d32-89e3-13d8d94af3f6"},{"title":"Suicidal honor","subtitle":"General Nogi and the writings of Mori Ōgai and Natsume Sōseki","authors":[{"authorName":"Bargen, Doris G","roleTerm":"creator"}],"lcCallNumber":"DS884.5 .B37 2006","ddCallNumber":"394/.880952","isbn":"0824829980 (hardcover : alk. paper)","abstract":"","subjects":["In literature","Criticism and interpretation","Japanese literature — History and criticism — 1868-","Seppuku","Suicide in literature"],"publisherName":"University of Hawaiʻi Press","publishedDate":"c2006","resourceId":"9711ae92-fd2b-47a3-9aa4-12f329769b83"},{"title":"Natsume Sōseki \"Kokoro\" ron, Table of contents only","subtitle":"","authors":[{"authorName":"Tokunaga, Mitsuhiro","roleTerm":"creator"}],"lcCallNumber":"PL812.A8 K638 2008","ddCallNumber":"","isbn":"9784759916782","abstract":"","subjects":[],"publisherName":"Kazama Shobō","publishedDate":"2008","resourceId":"ddaa8983-5056-4bc6-8243-8f3d5a226923"},{"title":"Theory of literature and other critical writings","subtitle":"","authors":[{"authorName":"Natsume, Sōseki","roleTerm":"creator"},{"authorName":"Bourdaghs, Michael K","roleTerm":""},{"authorName":"Ueda, Atsuko","roleTerm":""},{"authorName":"Murphy, Joseph A.

He would later look back on his Theory of Literature (1907) as an immature and unfinished work, but it is in fact an astonishingly original attempt at constructing a model for understanding all literature through the experience of reading.\" \"The Theory of Literature foreshadows the ideas and concepts that would later form the critical foundations of formalism, structuralism, reader-response theory, cognitive science, and postcolonialism. It remains an unprecedented work of literary theory, unmistakably modern yet also clearly (and self-consciously) non-Western. In a later series of lectures and essays, Soseki continued to develop his ideas. This material, some of it never before translated into English, is also included in the volume.

Through an in-depth account of each of these memorable projects, it examines the ways in which artists as diverse as Rachel Whiteread and Takashi Murakami, Christian Boltanski and Pipilotti Rist, and Andrea Zittel and Vik Muniz have created a dynamic experience of contemporary art. From Paul Pfeiffer's Orpheus Descending, a video work documenting the brief life-cycle of a flock of chickens, shown in the World Trade Center and World Financial Center, to Josiah McElheny's The Metal Party, an elaborate reconstruction of an event held at the Bauhaus in 1929, these projects address a multitude of issues related to urban living, site-specificity, and the impact of public art on both casual passersby and local communities.\" \"For artists, creating work outside the museum or gallery's white box is both a challenging and a rewarding experience, an opportunity to use the public realm for an evolution of their studio practice. This book sheds new light on a key aspect of contemporary art, while also creating a lasting pictorial record of installations on view for perhaps only a few weeks or months. Plop documents the vitality of a changing city and the evolution of what it means for art to be \"public,\" providing a key reference work for everyone interested in public art and the international contemporary art scene.\"--BOOK JACKET","subjects":["Public art — Exhibitions —","Art, American — Exhibitions — — 20th century","Art, American — Exhibitions — — 21st century"],"publisherName":"Merrell Publishers in association with Public Art Fund, New York","publishedDate":"2004","resourceId":"c534fe8a-9f84-4287-b3a0-c35cb4ce6f30"},{"title":"Network externalities in the Japanese market of routers","subtitle":"","authors":[{"authorName":"Tanaka, Tatsuo","roleTerm":"creator"},{"authorName":"Murakami, Reiko","roleTerm":""}],"lcCallNumber":"HD9696.D383 J3 2003x","ddCallNumber":"","isbn":"","abstract":"","subjects":["Data transmission equipment industry — Econometric models — Japan","Routers (Computer networks) — Economic aspects — Japan","Market share — Econometric models — Japan"],"publisherName":"Competition Policy Research Center, Fair Trade Commission of Japan","publishedDate":"2003","resourceId":"6d1b4e69-3e5a-4149-ac41-55d8ccec4b80"},{"title":"Network effects in the Japanese word-processing software market","subtitle":"","authors":[{"authorName":"Yasaki, Yoshihito","roleTerm":"creator"},{"authorName":"Murakami, Reiko","roleTerm":""}],"lcCallNumber":"HD9696.2.J32 Y37 2003x","ddCallNumber":"","isbn":"","abstract":"","subjects":["Computer software industry — Econometric models — Japan","Market share — Econometric models — Japan"],"publisherName":"Competition Policy Research Center, Fair Trade Commission of Japan","publishedDate":"2003","resourceId":"0f48d395-5d22-4fd1-ad63-8c01423eed7a"},{"title":"Collision processes of Li³⁺ with atomic hydrogen","subtitle":"cross section database","authors":[{"authorName":"Murakami, I.

On the contrary, Murakami finds that moral drama came into its own in the sixteenth century as a method for challenging normative views on ethics, economics, social rank, and political obligation. From its inception in itinerate troupe productions of the late fifteenth century, \"moral play\" served not as a cloistered form, but as a volatile public forum. This book demonstrates how the genre's apparently inert conventions from allegorical characters to the battle between good and evil for Mankind's soul veiled critical explorations of topical issues. Through close analysis of plays representing key moments of formal and ideological innovation from 1465 to 1599, Murakami makes a new argument for what is at stake in the much-discussed anxiety around the entwined social practices of professional theater and the emergent capitalist market. Moral play fostered a phenomenon that was ultimately more threatening to the peace of the realm than either theater or the notorious market--a political self-consciousness that gave rise to ephemeral, non-elite counterpublics who defined themselves against institutional forms of authority\"--","subjects":["Moralities, English — History and criticism","English drama — History and criticism — Early modern and Elizabethan, 1500-1600","Literature and society — History — — 16th century","Christian drama, English — History and criticism"],"publisherName":"Routledge","publishedDate":"2011","resourceId":"5b148c57-c3af-4363-ac47-4030d2aa6d12"},{"title":"Rebuild","subtitle":"","authors":[{"authorName":"Murakami, Sachiko","roleTerm":"creator"}],"lcCallNumber":"PR9199.4.M866 R43 2011","ddCallNumber":"C811/.6","isbn":"9780889226708","abstract":"","subjects":[[]],"publisherName":"Talonbooks","publishedDate":"2011","resourceId":"dc5f4bbe-69fa-4e32-a1f0-6b70a9d6bae3"},{"title":"1Q84","subtitle":"","authors":[{"authorName":"Murakami, Haruki","roleTerm":""},{"authorName":"Rubin, Jay","roleTerm":"translator"},{"authorName":"Gabriel, Philip","roleTerm":"translator"}],"lcCallNumber":"PL856.U673 A61213 2011","ddCallNumber":"895.6/35","isbn":"9780307593313","abstract":"An ode to George Orwell's \"1984\" told in alternating male and female voices relates the stories of Aomame, an assassin for a secret organization who discovers that she has been transported to an alternate reality, and Tengo, a mathematics lecturer and novice writer","subjects":["Man-woman relationships — Fiction","Man-woman relationships"],"publisherName":"Alfred A.

With the San Francisco Giants caught in a close pennant race and desperate for a left-handed reliever, Masanori was called up to join the big league club, becoming the first Japanese player in the Major Leagues. Featuring pinpoint control, a devastating curveball, and a friendly smile, Mashi became the Giants' top lefty reliever and one of the team's most popular players-- as well as a national hero in Japan. Not surprisingly, the Giants offered him a contract for the 1965 season. Murakami signed, announcing that he would be thrilled to stay in San Francisco. There was just one problem: the Nankai Hawks still owned his contract. The dispute over Murakami's contract would ignite an international incident that ultimately prevented other Japanese players from joining the Majors for thirty years.

The book was timely: Japan's subsequent \"bubble era\" of the 1980s saw the country booming. But since the economic bubble burst at the start of the 1990s, Japan has been in decline. Japan Restored by Clyde Prestowitz, taking up Vogel's baton, is written as a vision of Japan in the year 2050, when the country's economic recovery has made it a world leader in every area of human endeavor. Prestowitz looks back to the year 2014 as such a low point for Japan that a special reform commission was set up that helped the country regain its former position as a leader in technology, in business, and geopolitically. Looking at education, innovation, the role of women, corporate organization, energy, infrastructure, domestic government, and international alliances Prestowitz draws up a fascinating and controversial blueprint for the future success of Japan.

Research on lipid mediators initially started with analysis of the action of aspirin, and subsequent biochemical experiments identified many enzymes and receptors responsible for the biosynthesis and signal transduction of individual lipid mediators. Through the phenotypic analyses of transgenic and knockout mice, it has been shown that the dysregulation of some lipid mediators causes inflammatory, immune, or oncogenic disorders. Lipid mediators have attracted increased attention because their structures are conserved among different species, and their biosynthetic and signaling pathways have been deciphered at the molecular level. Many drugs that target lipid mediators are already being used in hospitals, and this book suggests further possibilities for development of a wide variety of such drugs. Very recently, highly sensitive mass spectrometry has begun to be used to identify novel lipid mediators that are present only in trace amounts in tissues but with robust biological activity. Written by international experts, this book provides readers a comprehensive view of lipid mediators and related topics and helps in the process of determining research targets for the near future","subjects":["Cytology","Life sciences","Human physiology","Lipids"],"publisherName":"Springer Japan","publishedDate":"2015","resourceId":"ffe1e428-675f-42ef-afda-22fb72880659"},{"title":"Dialogic pedagogy","subtitle":"the importance of dialogue in teaching and learning","authors":[{"authorName":"Skidmore, David","roleTerm":"editor"},{"authorName":"Murakami, Kyoko","roleTerm":"editor"}],"lcCallNumber":"P95.455 .D473 2016","ddCallNumber":"401/.4","isbn":"9781783096213","abstract":"","subjects":["Dialogue analysis","Language and languages — Study and teaching","Language teachers — Psychological aspects","Conversation analysis","Pedagogical content knowledge","Dialogism (Literary analysis)"],"publisherName":"Multilingual Matters","publishedDate":"","resourceId":"ff46db1a-5432-43a8-bed2-6b26fd29d881"},{"title":"Ozawa seiji","subtitle":"Seiji Ozawa","authors":[{"authorName":"Ozawa, Seiji","roleTerm":""},{"authorName":"Ōkubo, Michiharu","roleTerm":"photographer"},{"authorName":"Murakami, Haruki","roleTerm":"writer of supplementary textual content"}],"lcCallNumber":"ML422.O9 A3 2016","ddCallNumber":"","isbn":"9784103502111","abstract":"","subjects":["Conductors (Music) — Biography","Conductors (Music) — Biography — Japan","Conductors (Music) — Biography —"],"publisherName":"Shinchosha","publishedDate":"2016","resourceId":"a277e259-fc85-4c82-a1f0-8d12402dbf38"},{"title":"Absolutely on music","subtitle":"conversations","authors":[{"authorName":"Ozawa, Seiji","roleTerm":""},{"authorName":"Murakami, Haruki","roleTerm":"author"},{"authorName":"Rubin, Jay","roleTerm":"translator"}],"lcCallNumber":"ML422.O9 A5 2016","ddCallNumber":"784.2092","isbn":"9780385354349","abstract":"","subjects":["Conductors (Music) — Interviews","Music — History and criticism","Conductors (Music)","Music"],"publisherName":"Alfred A.

To unify the theories, an axiomatic approach has been taken since the 1960's. This book is intended as a guide for the axiomatic approach to the theory of equations with infinite delay and a culmination of the results obtained in this way. It can also be used as a textbook for a graduate course. The prerequisite knowledge is foundations of analysis including linear algebra and functional analysis.

Incorporation of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) that bind the ABL kinase domain into frontline regimens induces complete remissions in greater than 90% of patients, but most relapse with resistance mutations in ABL that disfavor drug binding. This suggests that relapses after TKI therapy remain addicted to ABL kinase activity. In contrast to currently approved TKIs, type IV inhibitors bind the spatially distinct myristate site in the ABL kinase domain and allosterically modulate BCR-ABL function. We hypothesize that the combination of catalytic and allosteric inhibitors can prevent the emergence of cross-resistant clones and cure some BCR-ABL+ ALLs. If this hypothesis proves correct, it would revolutionize the treatment of BCR-ABL+ ALL. Even in cases where combined ABL blockade is not curative, we would have the unique opportunity to define mechanisms of in vivo resistance – mutational, transcriptional, or differentiation state-mediated – to what is potentially the future standard therapy for BCR-ABL+ ALL. The studies described herein all relate to our overarching goal of informing curative therapeutic strategies for BCR-ABL ALL by defining the factors that modulate sensitivity and resistance to targeted ABL inhibition.","subjects":[[]],"publisherName":"","publishedDate":"","resourceId":"f2fe3964-002d-4062-bb22-b7fcff61b366"},{"title":"Dances with Sheep","subtitle":"The Quest for Identity in the Fiction of Murakami Haruki","authors":[{"authorName":"Strecher, Matthew","roleTerm":"creator"}],"lcCallNumber":"PL856.U673 Z86 2002","ddCallNumber":"895.6/35","isbn":"1-929280-07-6","abstract":"","subjects":["Criticism and interpretation"],"publisherName":"Center for Japanese Studies/University of Michigan","publishedDate":"2002","resourceId":"518a818c-3b28-4b3a-bbc5-6345b09e5d47"},{"title":"Big data surveillance and security intelligence","subtitle":"the Canadian case","authors":[{"authorName":"Lyon, David","roleTerm":"editor"},{"authorName":"Wood, David Murakami","roleTerm":"editor"},{"authorName":"Project Muse","roleTerm":""}],"lcCallNumber":"JL86.I58 B54 2020","ddCallNumber":"327.1271","isbn":"0774864192","abstract":"","subjects":["Electronic surveillance — Canada","Intelligence service — Canada","Cyber intelligence (Computer security) — Canada","National security — Canada","National security — International cooperation","Data protection — Canada","Cyber intelligence (Computer security)","Data protection","Electronic surveillance","Intelligence service","National security"],"publisherName":"UBC Press","publishedDate":"2020","resourceId":"7fc4f94a-17eb-4f8e-9416-b139cd8c24ba"},{"title":"After identity","subtitle":"three essays on the musicality of life","authors":[{"authorName":"Grăjdian-Mengel, Maria","roleTerm":"creator"}],"lcCallNumber":"HM621 .G73 2019","ddCallNumber":"","isbn":"9786062610838","abstract":"\"What the phenomena described in this booklet have in common is the fact that they are all media-related appearances in the spectrum of popular culture in contemporary Japan, while possessing music as their secondary tool\" -- page 9","subjects":["Criticism and interpretation","Popular culture — Japan","Music — Japan"],"publisherName":"Pro Universitaria","publishedDate":"2019","resourceId":"5921fb8e-aae3-494c-a7f7-8dd282ee0a5b"},{"title":"Le Corbusier and the age of purism","subtitle":"","authors":[{"authorName":"Le Corbusier","roleTerm":""},{"authorName":"Murakami, Hiroya","roleTerm":""},{"authorName":"Kokuritsu Seiyō Bijutsukan","roleTerm":"host institution"}],"lcCallNumber":"NA1053.J4 A4 2019","ddCallNumber":"","isbn":"9784907442293","abstract":"","subjects":[],"publisherName":"The Tokyo Shimbun","publishedDate":"","resourceId":"72d5c321-9685-42d7-af8f-0246e5014aa4"},{"title":"Haruki Murakami and the search for self-therapy","subtitle":"stories from the second basement","authors":[{"authorName":"Dil, Jonathan","roleTerm":""}],"lcCallNumber":"PL856.U673 Z64 2022eb","ddCallNumber":"704","isbn":"9781350270572","abstract":"\"Haruki Murakami, a global literary phenomenon, has said that he started writing fiction as a means of self-therapy. What he has not discussed as much is what he needed self-therapy for. This book argues that by understanding more about why Murakami writes, and by linking this with the question of how he writes, readers can better understand what he writes. Murakami's fiction, in other words, can be read as a search for self-therapy. In five chapters which explore Murakami's fourteen novels to date, this book argues that there are four prominent therapeutic threads woven through Murakami's fiction that can be traced back to his personal traumas - most notably Murakami's falling out with his late father and the death of a former girlfriend -- and which have also transcended them in significant ways as they have been transformed into literary fiction. The first thread looks at the way melancholia must be worked through for mourning to occur and healing to happen; the second thread looks at how symbolic acts of sacrifice can help to heal intergenerational trauma; the third thread looks at the way people with avoidant attachment styles can begin to open themselves up to love again; the fourth thread looks at how individuation can manifest as a response to nihilism. Meticulously researched and written with sensitivity, the result is a sophisticated exploration of Murakami's published novels as an evolving therapeutic project that will be of great value to all scholars of Japanese literature and culture.\"--","subjects":["Criticism and interpretation","Japanese fiction — History and criticism — Shōwa period, 1926-1989","Japanese literature — 20th century","Psychology and literature","Meditation in literature"],"publisherName":"Bloomsbury Academic","publishedDate":"2022","resourceId":"2fd22283-4c1c-4cf8-a0a4-03f91bdc655e"},{"title":"Guides to Japanese culture","subtitle":"","authors":[{"authorName":"Murakami, Hyōe","roleTerm":""},{"authorName":"Seidensticker, Edward","roleTerm":""},{"authorName":"Nihon Bunka Kenkyūjo (Tokyo)","roleTerm":""}],"lcCallNumber":"Z3306 .G84","ddCallNumber":"","isbn":"0870404032","abstract":"","subjects":["Civilization — Japan"],"publisherName":"Japan Culture Institute","publishedDate":"1977","resourceId":"768d3d2e-c0fc-48fa-a12b-dad450c30625"},{"title":"Turnpike optimality in input-output systems","subtitle":"theory and application for planning","authors":[{"authorName":"Tsukui, Jinkichi","roleTerm":"creator"},{"authorName":"Murakami, Yasusuke","roleTerm":"joint author"}],"lcCallNumber":"","ddCallNumber":"","isbn":"0444852212","abstract":"","subjects":["Turnpike theory (Economics)","Input-output analysis"],"publisherName":"North-Holland Pub.

Frank, an overweight American tourist, has hired Kenji to take him on a guided tour of Tokyo's sleazy nightlife on three successive evenings. But Frank's behavior is so strange that Kenji begins to entertain a horrible suspicion: that his new client is in fact the serial killer currently terrorizing the city. It isn't until the second night, however, in a scene that will shock you and make you laugh and make you hate yourself for laughing, that Kenji learns exactly how much he has to fear and how irrevocably his encounter with this great white whale of an American will change his life. Kenji's intimate knowledge of Tokyo's sex industry, his thoughtful observations and wisecracks about the emptiness and hypocrisy of contemporary Japan, and his insights into the shockingly widespread phenomena of \"compensated dating\" and selling it among Japanese schoolgirls, give us plenty to think about on every page.

Comprising 29 chapters divided into four major parts, the book describes the molecular natures of enzymes, transporters, and receptors for lipid mediators (Part I), the function of lipid mediators in Drosophila and Zebrafish (Part II), the relationships between lipid mediators and various diseases (Part III), and detailed procedures of extraction, preparation, and quantification of lipid mediators (Part IV). Research on lipid mediators initially started with analysis of the action of aspirin, and subsequent biochemical experiments identified many enzymes and receptors responsible for the biosynthesis and signal transduction of individual lipid mediators. Through the phenotypic analyses of transgenic and knockout mice, it has been shown that the dysregulation of some lipid mediators causes inflammatory, immune, or oncogenic disorders. Lipid mediators have attracted increased attention because their structures are conserved among different species, and their biosynthetic and signaling pathways have been deciphered at the molecular level. Many drugs that target lipid mediators are already being used in hospitals, and this book suggests further possibilities for development of a wide variety of such drugs. Very recently, highly sensitive mass spectrometry has begun to be used to identify novel lipid mediators that are present only in trace amounts in tissues but with robust biological activity.

It combines environmental engineering and landscape sciences perspectives on urban region issues, making the book a unique work in urban study literatures. Today’s extended urban regions often maintain rural features within their boundaries and also have strong social, economic, and environmental linkages with the surrounding rural areas. These intra- and inter- linkages between urban and rural systems produce complex interdependences with global and local sustainability issues, including those of climate change, resource exploitation, ecosystem degradation and human wellbeing. Planning and other prospective actions for the sustainability of urban regions, therefore, cannot solely depend on “urban” approaches; rather, they need to integrate broader landscape perspectives that take extended social and ecological systems into consideration. This volume shows how to untangle, diagnose, and transform urban regions through distinctive thematic contributions across a variety of academic disciplines ranging from environmental engineering and geography to landscape ecology and urban planning. Case studies, selected from across the world and investigating urban regions in East Asia, Europe, North America and South-East Asia, collectively illustrate shared and differentiated drivers of sustainability challenges and provide informative inputs to global and local sustainability initiatives","subjects":["Sustainable development","Urban ecology (Biology)","Landscape ecology"],"publisherName":"Springer Japan","publishedDate":"2017","resourceId":"272dc8ff-d59a-4053-89a0-ab4beeef752a"},{"title":"Services Computing for Language Resources","subtitle":"","authors":[{"authorName":"Murakami, Yohei","roleTerm":""},{"authorName":"Lin, Donghui","roleTerm":""},{"authorName":"Ishida, Toru","roleTerm":""}],"lcCallNumber":"QA75.5-76.95","ddCallNumber":"006.35","isbn":"981-10-7793-2","abstract":"Describing the technologies to combine language resources flexibly as web services, this book provides valuable case studies for those who work in services computing, language resources, human–computer interaction (HCI), computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW), and service science. The authors have been operating the Language Grid, which wraps existing language resources as atomic language services and enables users to compose new services by combining them. From architecture level to service composition level, the book explains how to resolve infrastructural and operational difficulties in sharing and combining language resources, including interoperability of language service infrastructures, various types of language service policies, human services, and service failures. The research based on the authors’ operating experiences of handling complicated issues such as intellectual property and interoperability of language resources contributes to exploitation of language resources as a service. On the other hand, both the analysis based on using services and the design of new services can bring significant results. A new style of multilingual communication supported by language services is worthy of analysis in HCI/CSCW, and the design process of language services is the focus of valuable case studies in service science. By using language resources in different ways based on the Language Grid, many activities are highly regarded by diverse communities. This book consists of four parts: (1) two types of language service platforms to interconnect language services across service grids, (2) various language service composition technologies that improve the reusability, efficiency, and accuracy of composite services, (3) research work and activities in creating language resources and services, and (4) various applications and tools for understanding and designing language services that well support intercultural collaboration","subjects":["Computers","Natural language processing (Computer science)","Artificial intelligence","Computational linguistics"],"publisherName":"Springer Singapore","publishedDate":"2018","resourceId":"5859eeb8-1ca8-4abc-a89a-12a819c28531"},{"title":"The Penguin book of Japanese short stories","subtitle":"","authors":[{"authorName":"Rubin, Jay","roleTerm":""},{"authorName":"Murakami, Haruki","roleTerm":"writer of introduction"}],"lcCallNumber":"PL782.E8 P46 2018","ddCallNumber":"895.630108","isbn":"9780141395623","abstract":"Presents an anthology celebrating the art of the Japanese short story, from its origins in the nineteenth century to the remarkable practitioners writing today.

Here the colored Jones polynomial is a generalization of the celebrated Jones polynomial and is defined by using a so-called R-matrix that is associated with the N-dimensional representation of the Lie algebra sl(2;C). The volume conjecture was first stated by R. Kashaev in terms of his own invariant defined by using the quantum dilogarithm. Later H. Murakami and J. Murakami proved that Kashaev’s invariant is nothing but the N-dimensional colored Jones polynomial evaluated at the Nth root of unity. Then the volume conjecture turns out to be a conjecture that relates an algebraic object, the colored Jones polynomial, with a geometric object, the volume. In this book we start with the definition of the colored Jones polynomial by using braid presentations of knots. Then we state the volume conjecture and give a very elementary proof of the conjecture for the figure-eight knot following T. Ekholm. We then give a rough idea of the “proof”, that is, we show why we think the conjecture is true at least in the case of hyperbolic knots by showing how the summation formula for the colored Jones polynomial “looks like” the hyperbolicity equations of the knot complement. We also describe a generalization of the volume conjecture that corresponds to a deformation of the complete hyperbolic structure of a knot complement. This generalization would relate the colored Jones polynomial of a knot to the volume and the Chern–Simons invariant of a certain representation of the fundamental group of the knot complement to the Lie group SL(2;C).

Like the rest of Japanese society, Buddhist institutions, individuals, and thought were drawn into the dynamics of confronting the modern age. Japanese Buddhism had to face multiple challenges, but it also contributed to modern Japanese society in numerous ways. Buddhism and Modernity: Sources from Nineteenth-Century Japan makes accessible the voices of Japanese Buddhists during the early phase of high modernity.The volume offers original translations of key texts—many available for the first time in English—by central actors in Japan’s transition to the modern era, including the works of Inoue Enryō, Gesshō, Hara Tanzan, Shimaji Mokurai, Kiyozawa Manshi, Murakami Senshō, Tanaka Chigaku, and Shaku Sōen. All of these writers are well recognized by Buddhist studies scholars and Japanese historians but have drawn little attention elsewhere; this stands in marked contrast to the reception of Japanese Buddhism since D. T. Suzuki, the towering figure of Japanese Zen in the first half of the twentieth century. The present book fills the chronological gap between the premodern era and the twentieth century by focusing on the crucial transition period of the nineteenth century.Issues central to the interaction of Japanese Buddhism with modernity inform the five major parts of the work: sectarian reform, the nation, science and philosophy, social reform, and Japan and Asia. Throughout the chapters, the globally entangled dimension—both in relation to the West, especially the direct and indirect impact of Christianity, and to Buddhist Asia—is of great importance. The Introduction emphasizes not only how Japanese Buddhism was part of a broader, globally shared reaction of religions to the specific challenges of modernity, but also goes into great detail in laying out the specifics of the Japanese case","subjects":["Buddhism — History — — Japan — 19th century"],"publisherName":"University of Hawaii Press,","publishedDate":"","resourceId":"548c494d-6085-4511-adad-f8caf524aa29"},{"title":"Reading the Tale of Genji","subtitle":"its picture-scrolls, texts and romance","authors":[{"authorName":"Stanley-Baker, Richard","roleTerm":""},{"authorName":"Tambling, Jeremy","roleTerm":""},{"authorName":"Murakami, Fuminobu","roleTerm":""},{"authorName":"E.J.

The Japanese themselves are conscious of the lush green of their homeland, which they sometimes refer to as \"the green archipelago.\" Yet, based on its fragile geography and centuries of extremely dense human occupation, Japan today should be an impoverished, slum-ridden, peasant society subsisting on a barren, eroded moonscape characterized by bald mountains and debris-strewn lowlands.In fact, as Conrad Totman argues in this pathbreaking work based on prodigious research, this lush verdue is not a monument to nature's benevolence and Japanese aesthetic sensibilities, but the hard-earned result of generations of human toil that have converted the archipelago into one great forest preserve. Indeed, the author shows that until the late 1600s Japan was well on her way to ecological disaster due to exploitative forestry. During the Tokugawa period, however, an extraordinary change took place resulting in a system of \"regenerative forestry\" that averted the devastation of Japan's forests.

For most of Japan's musical history, however, no such role existed-composition and performance were deeply intertwined. Only when Japan began to embrace Western culture in the late nineteenth century did the role of the composer emerge. In Composing Japanese Musical Modernity, Bonnie Wade uses an investigation of this new musical role to offer new insights not just into Japanese music but Japanese modernity at large and global cosmopolitan culture. Wade examines the short history of the composer in Japanese society, looking at the creative and economic opportunities that have sprung up around them-or that they forged-during Japan's astonishingly fast modernization. She shows that modernist Japanese composers have not bought into the high modernist concept of the autonomous artist, instead remaining connected to the people. Articulating Japanese modernism in this way, Wade tells a larger story of international musical life, of the spaces in which tradition and modernity are able to meet and, ultimately, where modernity itself has been made","subjects":["Composers — Western influences — Japan — 20th century","Music — History and criticism — Japan","Music — Japan"],"publisherName":"University of Chicago Press","publishedDate":"","resourceId":"22812f29-b8c4-4572-b326-66164c71d2b2"},{"title":"The culture of the quake","subtitle":"the great Kanto Earthquake and Taishō Japan","authors":[{"authorName":"Bates, Alex","roleTerm":""}],"lcCallNumber":"PL726.63.K356 B38 2015","ddCallNumber":"895.609/0044","isbn":"9781929280865 (pbk. : alk. paper)","abstract":"\"The Culture of the Quake is first and foremost an exploration of Taishō-era narrative fiction.

The households studied here differ in locale and in status-from samurai to outcaste, peasant to merchant-but what unites them is life within the social order of the Tokugawa shogunate. The circumstances and choices that made one household unlike another were framed, then as now, by prevailing laws, norms, and controls on resources. These factors led the majority to form stem families, which are a focus of this volume. The essays in this book draw on rich sources-population registers, legal documents, personal archives, and popular literature-to combine accounts of collective practices (such as the adoption of heirs) with intimate portraits of individual actors (such as a murderous wife).

To study government competence in World War II Japan offers an intriguing laboratory. In this book, Yoshiro Miwa shows that the Japanese government did not conduct requisite planning for the war by any means. It made its choices on an ad hoc basis and the war itself quickly became a dead end.

Through an examination of rent rolls, land registers, maps, and other data describing individual estates he reveals a cultural framework, one that produced and shaped meaning for residents and proprietors. Keirstead's discussion of peasant uprisings shows that the system, however, did not define a stable, closed structure, but was built upon contested terrain. Drawing on the works of Foucault,de Certeau, and Geertz, among others,this book illuminates the presuppositions about space and society that underwrote estate holding. It traces how the system reordered the social and physical landscape, establishing identity for both rulers and subjects. Estate holders, seeking to counter the fluid movement of populations across estate boundaries, pressed into service a social distinction between \"peasants\" and \"wanderers.\" Peasant rebels made use of the fiction that the estate comprised a natural community in order to resist proprietorial exactions. In these instances, Keirstead contends, the estate system reveals its governing logic: social and political divisions were articulated in spatial terms; power was exercised (and contested) through geography.Originally published in 1992.The Princeton Legacy Library uses the latest print-on-demand technology to again make available previously out-of-print books from the distinguished backlist of Princeton University Press.

The exhibition features the work of two artists who were friends and contemporaries: Isamu Noguchi and Saburo Hasegawa. This volume is intended to give scholars and general readers access to a wealth of archival material and writings by and about Saburo Hasegawa. While Noguchi's reputation as a preeminent American sculptor of the twentieth century only grows stronger, Saburo Hasegawa is less well known, despite being considered the most literate artist in Japan during his lifetime (1906-1957). Hasegawa is credited with introducing abstraction in Japan in the mid 1930s, and he worked as an artist in diverse media including oil and ink painting, photography, and printmaking. He was also a theorist and widely published essayist, curator, teacher, and multilingual conversationalist. This valuable trove of Hasegawa material includes the entire manuscript for a 1957 Hasegawa memorial volume, with its beautiful essays by philosopher Alan Watts, Oakland Museum Director Paul Mills, and Japan Times art writer Elise Grilli, as well as various unpublished writings by Hasegawa. The ebook edition will also include a dozen essays by Hasegawa from the postwar period, and one prewar essay, professionally translated for this publication to give a sense of Hasegawa's voice.

This collection of essays, each based on new research, offers original insights into various aspects of modern Japanese cultural history from \"modernist\" architecture to women as cultural symbols, popular songs to the rhetoric of empire-building, and more. The volume is organized around three general topics: geographical and cultural space; cosmopolitanism and national identity; and diversity, autonomy, and integration. Within these the authors have identified a number of thematic tensions that link the essays: high and low culture in cultural production and dissemination; national and ethnic identities; empire and ethnicity; the center and the periphery; naichi (homeland) and gaichi (overseas); urban and rural; public and private; migration and barriers. The volume opens up new avenues of exploration for the study of modern Japanese history and culture. If, as one of the authors contends, the imperative is \" to understand more fully the historical forces that made Japan what it is today,\" these studies of Japan's \"competing modernities\" point the way to answers to some of the country's most challenging historical questions in this century.

When Joe Rosenthal's photograph of the event becomes a symbol of hope for the families at home, the three surviving men are pulled from combat and sent on a tour across America to raise desperately-needed bond money. It is a trip that brings out the truths of both that symbolic act, and their lives during war. There were no cheering crowds to see Mike, Harlon, Ira, Doc, Rene and Franklin off as they departed Camp Tarawa. To maintain military secrecy they journeyed in the dead of night. Their destination was island X. That was all they knew. Through a hail of machine-gun and mortar fire that left the beaches strewn with comrades, the American Marines battled to the island's highest peak. And there they raised a flag. Here is the true story behind perhaps the most famous moment in American military history -- the raising of the U.S. flag on the Pacific island of Iwo Jima, February 23, 1945 -- and the immortal photograph that lifted the heart and spirit of a nation at war. James Bradley is the son of John \"Doc\" Bradley, one of the six flag raisers. In the course of writing \"Flags of Our Fathers,\" James Bradley conducted more than 300 interviews with World War II veterans and their families.\"--Cover Video for American Cinema Class","subjects":["History — Drama — 20th century","Hospital corpsmen — Drama","Iwo Jima, Battle of, Japan, 1945 — Drama","Marines — Drama — United States","World War, 1939-1945 — Campaigns — Drama — Japan","World War, 1939-1945 — Economic aspects — Drama — United States","Armed Forces — Hospital corpsmen","Economics","Marines","Military campaigns"],"publisherName":"Dreamworks Home Entertainment","publishedDate":"","resourceId":"b79f98cc-3b08-428a-8049-5d6abb325e1b"},{"title":"Fukushima and the arts","subtitle":"negotiating nuclear disaster","authors":[{"authorName":"Geilhorn, Barbara","roleTerm":"editor"},{"authorName":"Iwata-Weickgenannt, Kristina","roleTerm":"editor"}],"lcCallNumber":"PL726.87.F87 F85 2016","ddCallNumber":"895.609/358520512","isbn":"9781138670587","abstract":"","subjects":["Japanese literature — History and criticism — Heisei period, 1989-","Fukushima Nuclear Disaster, Japan, 2011, in literature","Fukushima Nuclear Disaster, Japan, 2011, in motion pictures","Fukushima Nuclear Disaster, Japan, 2011 — Influence"],"publisherName":"New York","publishedDate":"2017","resourceId":"64ca6ecc-d7be-47d9-86ff-70af9f138bed"},{"title":"The Saburo Hasegawa Reader","subtitle":"","authors":[{"authorName":"Hart, Dakin","roleTerm":""},{"authorName":"Johnson, Mark Dean","roleTerm":""}],"lcCallNumber":"N7359.H3727","ddCallNumber":"709.2","isbn":"0-520-29899-3","abstract":"At publication date, a free ebook version of this title will be available through Luminos, University of California Press's Open Access publishing program.

The exhibition features the work of two artists who were friends and contemporaries: Isamu Noguchi and Saburo Hasegawa. This volume is intended to give scholars and general readers access to a wealth of archival material and writings by and about Saburo Hasegawa. While Noguchi's reputation as a preeminent American sculptor of the twentieth century only grows stronger, Saburo Hasegawa is less well known, despite being considered the most literate artist in Japan during his lifetime (1906-1957). Hasegawa is credited with introducing abstraction in Japan in the mid 1930s, and he worked as an artist in diverse media including oil and ink painting, photography, and printmaking. He was also a theorist and widely published essayist, curator, teacher, and multilingual conversationalist. This valuable trove of Hasegawa material includes the entire manuscript for a 1957 Hasegawa memorial volume, with its beautiful essays by philosopher Alan Watts, Oakland Museum Director Paul Mills, and Japan Times art writer Elise Grilli, as well as various unpublished writings by Hasegawa. The ebook edition will also include a dozen essays by Hasegawa from the postwar period, and one prewar essay, professionally translated for this publication to give a sense of Hasegawa's voice. This resource will be an invaluable tool for scholars and students interested in midcentury East Asian and American art and tracing the emergence of contemporary issues of hybridity, transnationalism, and notions of a \"global Asia.\"","subjects":["Art, Japanese — 20th century"],"publisherName":"University of California Press","publishedDate":"","resourceId":"0502048d-3404-495e-8d04-d9b6a6212fe4"},{"title":"The United States and Japan","subtitle":"","authors":[{"authorName":"Reischauer, Edwin O","roleTerm":""}],"lcCallNumber":"","ddCallNumber":"","isbn":"9780674420229","abstract":"","subjects":[],"publisherName":"Harvard University Press,","publishedDate":"","resourceId":"97169474-3044-43a4-b306-d0d6d3303cf3"},{"title":"Abortion before Birth Control","subtitle":"The Politics of Reproduction in Postwar Japan","authors":[{"authorName":"Norgren, Christiana A.

The Japanese government legalized abortion in 1948 but did not approve the pill until 1999. In this carefully researched study, Tiana Norgren argues that these contradictory policies flowed from very different historical circumstances and interest group configurations. Doctors and family planners used a small window of opportunity during the Occupation to legalize abortion, and afterwards, doctors and women battled religious groups to uphold the law. The pill, on the other hand, first appeared at an inauspicious moment in history. Until circumstances began to change in the mid-1980s, the pharmaceutical industry was the pill's lone champion: doctors, midwives, family planners, and women all opposed the pill as a potential threat to their livelihoods, abortion rights, and women's health. Clearly written and interwoven with often surprising facts about Japanese history and politics, Norgren's book fills vital gaps in the cross-national literature on the politics of reproduction, a subject that has received more attention in the European and American contexts.

The households studied here differ in locale and in status-from samurai to outcaste, peasant to merchant-but what unites them is life within the social order of the Tokugawa shogunate. The circumstances and choices that made one household unlike another were framed, then as now, by prevailing laws, norms, and controls on resources. These factors led the majority to form stem families, which are a focus of this volume. The essays in this book draw on rich sources-population registers, legal documents, personal archives, and popular literature-to combine accounts of collective practices (such as the adoption of heirs) with intimate portraits of individual actors (such as a murderous wife). They highlight the variety and adaptability of households that, while shaped by a shared social order, do not conform to any stereotypical version of a Japanese family.","subjects":["Families — History — Japan — Edo period, 1600-1868","Social life and customs — Japan — 1600-1868","History — Japan — Tokugawa period, 1600-1868"],"publisherName":"University of California Press,","publishedDate":"","resourceId":"60a3f6a1-9a72-443b-a8db-6ac7e1f02a2d"},{"title":"Magazines and the Making of Mass Culture in Japan","subtitle":"","authors":[{"authorName":"Marshall, Amy Bliss","roleTerm":""}],"lcCallNumber":"PN5410.K55","ddCallNumber":"059/.95609042","isbn":"9781487516161","abstract":"Magazines & the Making of Mass Culture in Japan provides a detailed yet approachable analysis of the mechanisms central to the birth of mass culture in Japan by tracing the creation, production, and circulation of two critically important family magazines, Kingu (King) and Ie no hikari (Light of the Home). These magazines served to embed new instruments of mass communication and socialization within Japanese society and created mechanisms to facilitate the dissemination of hegemonic forms of discourse in Japan in the first half of the twentieth century. The amazing success of Kingu and Ie no hikari during the 1920s and 1930s not only established and normalized participation in a Japanese mass national audience - a community which had previously not existed - but also facilitated the rise of Japanese mass consumer culture in the postwar years. Amy Bliss Marshall argues that the postwar mass Japanese national consumer is foreshadowed by the mass national audience created by family magazines of the interwar era. This book analytically narrates the creation and development of such publications, one explicitly capitalist and one outwardly agrarian, based on missions with an overarching desire to create a mass Japanese magazine audience. Magazines & the Making of Mass Culture in Japan highlights the importance of the seemingly innocuous acts of mass, leisure consumption of magazines and the goods advertised therein, thus aiding our understanding of the creation and direction of a new form of social participation and understanding - an essential part of not only the culture but also the politics of the transwar period","subjects":["Japanese periodicals — History — 20th century","Periodicals — Social aspects — History — Japan — 20th century","Popular culture — History — Japan — 20th century"],"publisherName":"University of Toronto Press,","publishedDate":"","resourceId":"39198b6d-159e-4d2e-b2d3-069792fac10b"},{"title":"Japan’s Arduous Rejuvenation as a Global Power","subtitle":"Democratic Resilience and the US-China Challenge","authors":[{"authorName":"Teo, Victor","roleTerm":""}],"lcCallNumber":"DS801-897","ddCallNumber":"952","isbn":"981-13-6190-8","abstract":"This open access book assesses the profound impact of Japan’s aspirations to become a great power on Japanese security, democracy and foreign relations. Rather than viewing the process of normalization and rejuvenation as two decades of remilitarization in face of rapidly changing strategic environment and domestic political circumstances, this volume contextualizes Japan’s contemporary international relations against the longer grain of Japanese historical interactions. It demonstrates that policies and statecraft in the Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s era are a continuation of a long, unbroken and arduous effort by successive generations of leaders to preserve Japanese autonomy, enhance security and advance Japanese national interests. Arguing against the notion that Japan cannot work with China as long as the US-Japan alliance is in place, the book suggests that Tokyo could forge constructive relations with Beijing by engaging China in joint projects in and outside of the Asia-Pacific in issue areas such as infrastructure development or in the provision of international public goods. It also submits that an improvement in Japan-China relations would enhance rather than detract Japan-US relations and that Tokyo will find that her new found automony in the US-Japan alliance would not only accord her more political respect and strategic latitude, but also allow her to ameliorate the excesses of American foreign policy adventurism, paving for her to become a truly normal great power","subjects":["Japan — History","Asia — Politics and government","World history"],"publisherName":"Springer Singapore","publishedDate":"2019","resourceId":"d52a3bfc-a379-43d4-985a-ab14153191fc"},{"title":"Japan and China","subtitle":"Mutual Representations in the Modern Era","authors":[{"authorName":"Wataru, Masuda","roleTerm":""}],"lcCallNumber":"GN625-GN635","ddCallNumber":"306.095","isbn":"1-137-08365-4","abstract":"The study of modern China and Japan have separately become major arenas of scholarship over the past three decades in the west, but little work has been done that brings these two histories together for the period prior to the twentieth century.

This directly contributed to his success in securing the reversion of Okinawa and other Japanese territories which had remained under US control since Japan’s surrender at the end of World War II. To accomplish this he was also forced to conclude secret agreements with President Richard Nixon, including one on nuclear weapons, which are explored fully.

Today, the few Kakure Kirishitan communities still in existence view the Tenchi as strange and flawed, expressing a distorted form of Christianity. It is, however, the only text produced by the Kakure Kirishitan that depicts their highly syncretistic tradition and provides a colorful window through which to examine the dynamics of religious acculturation","subjects":["Crypto-Christians — Japan"],"publisherName":"University of Hawaii Press,","publishedDate":"","resourceId":"dacfc2a8-8215-40be-bc50-37182c41cf02"},{"title":"OECD Economic Surveys","subtitle":"","authors":[{"authorName":"Publishing, OECD","roleTerm":"creator"},{"authorName":"Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Staff","roleTerm":""}],"lcCallNumber":"HC461 .A1","ddCallNumber":"330.952","isbn":"92-64-23238-9","abstract":"","subjects":[],"publisherName":"OECD Publishing","publishedDate":"2015","resourceId":"b98978c1-1ad4-495a-9371-8106768cf1b2"},{"title":"Gender, culture, and disaster in post-3.11 Japan","subtitle":"","authors":[{"authorName":"Koikari, Mire","roleTerm":""}],"lcCallNumber":"HV555.J3 K65 2020","ddCallNumber":"952.05/12","isbn":"9781350122499","abstract":"\"The Great East Japan Disaster - a compound catastrophe of earthquake, tsunami, and nuclear meltdown that began on March 11, 2011 - has ushered in a new era of cultural production dominated by discussions on safety and security, risk and vulnerability, and recovery and refortification.

From juvenile literature to civic manuals to policy statements, Koikari examines a vast array of primary sources to demonstrate how femininity and masculinity, readiness and preparedness, militarism and humanitarianism, and nationalism and transnationalism inform cultural formation and transformation triggered by the unprecedented crisis. Interdisciplinary in its orientation, the book reveals how militarism, neoliberalism, and neoconservatism drive Japan's resilience building while calling attention to historical precedents and transnational connections that animate the ongoing mobilization toward safety and security.

He illuminates the ways in which the imperial center and its individual colonies understood the concept of the Sphere, offering two sometimes competing, sometimes complementary, and always intertwined visions—one from Japan, the other from Burma and the Philippines.Yellen argues that, from 1940 to 1945, the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere epitomized two concurrent wars for Asia's future: the first was for a new type of empire in Asia, and the second was a political war, waged by nationalist elites in the colonial capitals of Rangoon and Manila. Exploring Japanese visions for international order in the face of an ever-changing geopolitical situation, The Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere explores wartime Japan's desire to shape and control its imperial future while its colonies attempted to do the same. At Japan's zenith as an imperial power, the Sphere represented a plan for regional domination; by the end of the war, it had been recast as the epitome of cooperative internationalism.

Japan's emperor system is the last remaining sovereignty of its kind in human history, and this volume is indispensable when considering what sovereignty itself means in the present. To that end, the classical patterns established in the Heian period are superbly analyzed in this volume through the dual approach of 'centers and peripheries.'\" -Hotate Michihisa, Historiographical Institute, University of TokyoThe first three centuries of the Heian period (794-1086) saw some of its most fertile innovations and epochal achievements in Japanese literature and the arts. It was also a time of important transitions in the spheres of religion and politics, as aristocratic authority was consolidated in Kyoto, powerful court factions and religious institutions emerged, and adjustments were made in the Chinese-style system of ruler-ship. At the same time, the era's leaders faced serious challenges from the provinces that called into question the primacy and efficiency of the governmental system and tested the social/cultural status quo. Heian Japan, Centers and Peripheries, the first book of its kind to examine the early Heian from a wide variety of multidisciplinary perspectives, offers a fresh look at these seemingly contradictory trends.Essays by fourteen leading American, European, and Japanese scholars of art history, history, literature, and religions take up core texts and iconic images, cultural achievements and social crises, and the ever-fascinating patterns and puzzles of the time. The authors tackle some of Heian Japan's most enduring paradigms as well as hitherto unexplored problems in search of new ways of understanding the currents of change as well as the processes of institutionalization that shaped the Heian scene, defined the contours of its legacies, and make it one of the most intensely studied periods of the Japanese past.Contributors: Ryûichi Abé, Mikael Adolphson, Bruce Batten, Robert Borgen, Wayne Farris, Karl Friday, G.

It takes a particular focus on the highly public start of the mixed court, the saiban-in system, and the jury system between 1928-1943. This was the first time Japanese citizens participated as decision makers in criminal law. The book assesses reasons for the jury system's failure, and its suspension in 1943, as well as the renewed interest in popular involvement in criminal justice at the end of the twentieth century. Popular Participation in Japanese Criminal Justice proceeds by explaining the process by which lay participation in criminal trials left the periphery to become an important national matter at the turn of the century. It shows that rather than an Anglo-American jury model, outline recommendations made by the Japanese Judicial Reform Council were for a mixed court of judges and laypersons to try serious cases. Concerns about the lay judge/saiban-in system are raised, as well as explanations for why it is flourishing in contemporary society despite the failure of the jury system during the period 1928-1943.

The Japanese realized the advantage of this global trade, and their desire to capture albatross motivated them to advance into the Pacific.

As a consequence, the advance into the Pacific by the Japanese resulted in the expansion of Japanese territory. The author has interpreted this Japanese movement into the Pacific by making use of the framework of three distinct shifts: in the aim of their actions from birds to guano / phosphate ore, in the agents of action from individual speculators to commercial capital and then to monopolistic capital, and from the sea near Japan to the wider Pacific. This concept can be termed “a view of history centered on the albatross”","subjects":["Physical geography","Economic geography","Japan — History","Mineral resources"],"publisherName":"Springer Singapore","publishedDate":"2018","resourceId":"1dc4b1b9-5df5-459a-b4ff-1e980a07fd5c"},{"title":"The Earth writes","subtitle":"the Great Earthquake and the novel in post-3/11 Japan","authors":[{"authorName":"Haga, Kōichi","roleTerm":""}],"lcCallNumber":"PL747.87.T54 H34 2019","ddCallNumber":"895.63/609358520512","isbn":"9781498569033","abstract":"","subjects":["Tohoku Earthquake and Tsunami, Japan, 2011, in literature","Japanese fiction — History and criticism — Heisei period, 1989-","Fukushima Nuclear Disaster, Japan, 2011, in literature","Literature and society — History — Japan — 21st century","Climatic changes in literature","Earthquakes in literature","Japanese fiction"],"publisherName":"Lexington Books, an imprint of the Rowman & Littlefield Publishing Group, Inc.","publishedDate":"","resourceId":"83664604-a01c-4938-a5cb-3d6cadcf9bc2"},{"title":"Crime in Japan","subtitle":"A Psychological Perspective","authors":[{"authorName":"Bui, Laura","roleTerm":""},{"authorName":"Farrington, David P","roleTerm":""}],"lcCallNumber":"HV6001-7220.5","ddCallNumber":"364.3","isbn":"3-030-14097-0","abstract":"This book examines different aspects of crime and deviance in Japan using research and theories from psychological criminology. Dominant research literature often stereotypically claims that Japan has low crime compared to Western industrialised countries because its citizens are group-oriented, its social institutions benevolent and organised, and its public spaces are spotless and efficient. Bui and Farrington however found that there is a higher level of violence among young Japanese males compared to that among young American males. The authors use psychological criminology to investigate this claim and present what is known about crime and antisocial behaviour in Japan from a psychological perspective (e.g. mental disorders, brain dysfunction, and family criminality) and explain how this fits into the broader understanding of crime at the individual level. This original project is the most up-to-date work on crime in Japan and progresses the important, and underdeveloped, field of criminal psychology.","subjects":["Criminology","Law — Asia","Juvenile delinquents","Japan — History","Forensic psychology","Ethnology — Asia","Violence","Crime"],"publisherName":"Springer International Publishing","publishedDate":"2019","resourceId":"b784ea29-b3ff-49d0-b52d-03754734e094"},{"title":"Japanese Missions to the International Space Station","subtitle":"Hope from the East","authors":[{"authorName":"O'Sullivan, John","roleTerm":""}],"lcCallNumber":"T-TX","ddCallNumber":"629.40952","isbn":"3-030-04534-X","abstract":"Japan has a rich history of human spaceflight, flying in space with both NASA and the Soviet/Russian space agencies over the years.

JAXA has contributed the largest single module to the ISS: the Kibō (Hope) science laboratory with its Logistics Module, Exposed Facility and robot arm. JAXA supplies the station with cargo and supplies on its automated cargo spacecraft, the H-II Transfer Vehicle (HTV), but it is the human endeavour that captures the imagination. From brief visits to six-month expeditions, from spacewalking to commanding the Earth’s only outpost in space, JAXA astronauts have played a vital role in the international project.

It may seem difficult to think of Japanese Buddhism as being linked to the realm of medical practices since religious healing is usually thought to be restricted to prayers for divine intervention. There is a surprising lack of scholarship regarding medicinal practices in Japanese Buddhism although an overwhelming amount of primary sources proves otherwise. A careful re-reading of well-known materials from a study-of-religions perspective, together with in some cases a first-time exploration of manuscripts and prints, opens new views on an understudied field. The book presents a topical survey and comprises chapters on treating sight-related diseases, women’s health, plant-based materica medica and medicinal gardens, and finally horse medicine to include veterinary knowledge. Terminological problems faced in working on this material – such as ‘religious’ or ‘magical healing’ as opposed to ‘secular medicine’ – are assessed.

Whereas most historians have argued that Hitler underestimated the American threat, Simms shows that Hitler embarked on a preemptive war with the United States precisely because he considered it such a potent adversary. The war against the Jews was driven both by his anxiety about combatting the supposed forces of international plutocracy and by a broader desire to maintain the domestic cohesion he thought necessary for survival on the international scene.

In light of today's global and transnational society, it is necessary, even pressing, to add a fourth dimension to this research agenda: cross-national exchange of ideas, people, and materials for the construction of a pedagogical regime. Japan in the Meiji period makes an ideal case for this inquiry. A nascent nation-state which tried to build a Western-style higher education system as part of its industrialization policy, Japan desperately needed models for institution-building for survival in an increasingly Euro- and American-centric world order. It first looked to Great Britain as a model for a strong industrial power, and the United States as a model for a young, fast growing country that was vigorously building administrative, educational, and industrial institutions. British and American teachers were dominant in Japanese higher education between the 1860s and 1880s, and many Japanese overseas students went to British and American universities and colleges to finish their training during this period. Increase of German presence in Japanese higher education (and in politics and administration) came later, from the 1880s onward. As a result, Meiji Japan became, so to speak, a kaleidoscope of Western (as well as Japanese) styles in many aspects of institutional as well as material culture\"--","subjects":["Chemistry — Study and teaching (Higher) — History — Japan — 19th century","Chemistry, Technical — Study and teaching (Higher) — History — Japan — 19th century","Chemistry — Study and teaching — History — Great Britain — 19th century","Chemistry — Study and teaching — History — United States — 19th century","Interdisciplinary approach in education","Chemistry — Study and teaching","Chemistry — Study and teaching (Higher)","Chemistry, Technical — Study and teaching (Higher)"],"publisherName":"Palgrave Macmillan","publishedDate":"2013","resourceId":"78d8c251-bdea-47a1-87fd-3a06ee8742bc"},{"title":"American sutra","subtitle":"a story of faith and freedom in the Second World War","authors":[{"authorName":"Williams, Duncan Ryūken","roleTerm":""}],"lcCallNumber":"D769.8.A6 W55 2019","ddCallNumber":"940.53/1773089956","isbn":"9780674986534","abstract":"\"The mass incarceration of Japanese Americans during World War II is not only a tale of injustice; it is a moving story of faith. In this pathbreaking account, Duncan Ryūken Williams reveals how, even as they were stripped of their homes and imprisoned in camps, Japanese-American Buddhists launched one of the most inspiring defenses of religious freedom in our nation's history, insisting that they could be both Buddhist and American. Nearly all Americans of Japanese descent were subject to bigotry and accusations of disloyalty, but Buddhists aroused particular suspicion. Government officials, from the White House to small-town mayors, believed that Buddhism was incompatible with American values. Intelligence agencies targeted the Buddhist community for surveillance, and Buddhist priests were deemed a threat to national security. On December 7, 1941, as the bombs fell on Pearl Harbor, Attorney General Francis Biddle issued a warrant to \"take into custody all Japanese\" classified as potential national security threats. The first person detained was Bishop Gikyō Kuchiba, leader of the Nishi Hongwanji Buddhist sect in Hawai`i. In the face of discrimination, dislocation, dispossession, and confinement, Japanese Americans turned to their faith to sustain them, whether they were behind barbed wire in camps or serving in one of the most decorated combat units in the European theater. Using newly translated sources and extensive interviews with survivors of the camps and veterans of the war, American Sutra reveals how the Japanese American community broadened our country's conception of religious freedom and forged a new American Buddhism.\"--Dust jacket","subjects":["Japanese Americans — Forced removal and internment, 1942-1945","Buddhists — History — United States — 20th century","Buddhism and state — History — United States — 20th century","Buddhism and politics — History — United States — 20th century","World War, 1939-1945 — Japanese Americans","Buddhism and politics","Buddhism and state","Buddhists","Japanese Americans","Race relations","Race relations — History — United States — 20th century"],"publisherName":"The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press","publishedDate":"2019","resourceId":"143016cb-06fc-40a7-8c57-9fc9299c7be3"},{"title":"Ottomans imagining Japan","subtitle":"East, Middle East, and non-western modernity at the turn of the twentieth century","authors":[{"authorName":"Worringer, Renée","roleTerm":"creator"}],"lcCallNumber":"DR479.J3 W67 2014","ddCallNumber":"327.56105209/04","isbn":"9781137384591 (hardback)","abstract":"\"The roots of today's \"clash of civilizations\" between the Islamic world and the West are not solely anchored in the legacy of the crusades or the early Islamic conquests: in many ways, it is a more contemporary story rooted in the nineteenth-century history of resistance to Western hegemony.

This happened despite the Tokugawa shogunate’s successful efforts to criminalize Christianity and even after the Meiji government took measures to limit its influence (after decriminalizing it out of diplomatic necessity). From journalism and literature, to medicine, education, and politics, the mark of Protestant Japanese is indelible. Herein lies the conundrum that has interested scholars for decades. How did Christianity overcome the ideological legacies of its past in Japan? How did Protestantism distinguish itself from the other options in the religious landscape like Buddhism and New Religions? And how did the religious movement’s social relevance and activism persist despite the new government’s measures to weaken the relationship between private religion and secular social life in Japan?In Church Space and the Capital in Prewar Japan, Garrett Washington responds to these questions with a spatially explicit study on the influence of the Protestant church in imperial Japan. He examines the physical and social spaces that Tokyo’s largest Japanese-led Protestant congregations cultivated between 1879 and 1923 and their broader social ties. These churches developed alongside, and competed with, the locational, architectural, and social spaces of Buddhism, Shinto, and Japanese New Religions. Their success depended on their pastors’ decisions about location and relocation, those men’s conceptualizations of the new imperial capital and aspirations for Japan, and the Western-style buildings they commissioned. Japanese pastors and laypersons grappled with Christianity’s relationships to national identity, political ideology, women’s rights, Japanese imperialism, and modernity; church-based group activities aimed to raise social awareness and improve society. Further, it was largely through attendees’ externalized ideals, experiences, and networks developed at church but expressed in their public lives outside the church that Protestant Christianity exerted such a visible, surprising influence on modern Japanese society. This groundbreaking history offers answers to longstanding questions about Protestant Christianity’s reputation and impact, but also goes further. It importantly uses a new space-centered perspective to focus attention on Japanese agency in the religion’s metamorphosis and social impact, adding a fresh narrative of cultural imperialism","subjects":["Protestant church buildings — History — — 19th century","Protestant church buildings — History — — 20th century","Protestantism — Social aspects — History — — 19th century","Protestantism — Social aspects — History — — 20th century","Religion and civil society — History — — 19th century","Religion and civil society — History — — 20th century"],"publisherName":"University of Hawaii Press,","publishedDate":"","resourceId":"58a02b44-200f-4de6-977d-3e7e395fa811"},{"title":"A history of popular culture in Japan","subtitle":"from the seventeenth century to the present","authors":[{"authorName":"Atkins, E.

Scholarly discussions on economic development in history, specifically those linked to industrialization or modern economic growth, have paid great attention to the formation and development of the market economy as a set of institutions able to augment people's welfare. The role of specific nonmarket practices for promoting the economic development and welfare has been a distinct concern, typically involving discussion of the state's economic policies. How have societies tackled those issues that the market did not? To what extent did those solutions reflect the structure of an economy? Public Goods Provision in the Early Modern Economy explores these questions by investigating efforts made for the provision of \";public goods\"; in early modern economies from the perspective of Japanese socioeconomic history during Tokugawa era (1603-1868), and by comparing those cases with others from Europe and China's economic history. The contributors focus on three areas of inquiry-early modern era welfare policies for the poor, infrastructure, and forest management-to provide both a unique perspective on Japanese public finance at local levels and a vantage point outside of Europe to encourage a more global view of early modern political economies that shaped subsequent modern transformations.","subjects":["Public goods — History","Economic conditions — Japan — 1600-1868","Economic conditions — Prussia (Germany)","Economic conditions — China — 1644-1912"],"publisherName":"University of California Press,","publishedDate":"","resourceId":"ab23f3ef-9037-410f-9d46-6eb448af420e"},{"title":"Empire of hope","subtitle":"the sentimental politics of Japanese decline","authors":[{"authorName":"Leheny, David Richard","roleTerm":""},{"authorName":"Project Muse","roleTerm":""}],"lcCallNumber":"JQ1681 .L45 2018","ddCallNumber":"306.20952","isbn":"9781501729089","abstract":"","subjects":["Political culture — History — Japan — 20th century","Political culture — History — Japan — 21st century","Emotions — Political aspects — History — Japan — 20th century","Emotions — Political aspects — History — Japan — 21st century","National characteristics, Japanese","Emotions — Political aspects","Political culture","Politics and government","Politics and government — Japan — 1989-"],"publisherName":"Cornell University Press","publishedDate":"2018","resourceId":"3bcb9072-6078-43df-bef9-55e0ed72498d"},{"title":"A Study of Samurai Income and Entrepreneurship","subtitle":"Quantitative Analyses of Economic and Social Aspects of the Samurai in Tokugawa and Meiji Japan","authors":[{"authorName":"Yamamura, Kōzō","roleTerm":""}],"lcCallNumber":"HT653.J3 Y34","ddCallNumber":"330.9/52/025","isbn":"9780674434707","abstract":"","subjects":["Entrepreneurship — History","Income — History — Japan","Samurai"],"publisherName":"Harvard University Press,","publishedDate":"","resourceId":"ac2e6438-8957-43f5-b082-dc379d37746b"},{"title":"The Money Doctors from Japan","subtitle":"Finance, Imperialism, and the Building of the Yen Bloc, 1895-1937","authors":[{"authorName":"Schiltz, Michael","roleTerm":""}],"lcCallNumber":"HG187.J3","ddCallNumber":"332/.042095209041","isbn":"1-68417-513-5","abstract":"","subjects":["Finance — Japan — History — 20th century","Foreign exchange — Political aspects — History — Japan — 20th century","Monetary policy — History — Japan — 20th century","Yen, Japanese — History — 20th century","Territorial expansion — History — Japan — 20th century"],"publisherName":"Harvard University Asia Center","publishedDate":"2012","resourceId":"c46e4c7e-5c49-481c-9f0c-accf580418ae"},{"title":"Seeking Sakyamuni","subtitle":"South Asia in the formation of modern Japanese Buddhism","authors":[{"authorName":"Jaffe, Richard M","roleTerm":""}],"lcCallNumber":"BQ691 .J34 2020","ddCallNumber":"294.30952","isbn":"0-226-62823-X","abstract":"Though fascinated with the land of their tradition's birth, virtually no Japanese Buddhists visited the Indian subcontinent before the nineteenth century.

With a state focused more on the emblematic goals of mechanization, urbanization, and a modern military, it fell upon local elites in villages across the country to bring rice production into the modern era. Middlemen of Modernity explores these elites and their actions in a region in northeastern Japan, presenting a view of the transformation of Japanese agriculture from the late nineteenth century to the mid-twentieth century. Meiji-era agricultural policy called for village elites to mobilize their wealth and local reputations to introduce improved farming methods, transform the physical landscape, and increase agricultural production. Farmers looked to the same figures to use their elevated status and government connections to direct public funds toward building prosperous villages. But economic shocks and social change created a new generation of elites with their own vision for agricultural improvement, leading to conditions that caused famine, economic disparity, and village unrest. The official and local responses to these discrepancies brought an end to the elite leadership of agricultural development at the beginning of the twentieth century, but its legacy set the course for farming and rural Japanese society for the next half century.Middlemen of Modernity offers a new perspective on Japanese modernization, one in which farming villages were neither premodern relics nor secondary concerns for the architects of the new nation. Modernity was worked out in the mud of rice paddies, as much as in any stateroom or factory, and the communities of Miyagi and villages throughout Japan helped shape the modern state, even as they were shaped by it. Mining a wealth of local sources, Christopher Craig provides a comprehensive study studded with stories of individual actors that remains closely connected to Japan's development and presents a history of agriculture from the early Meiji period to the postwar American occupation. Craig also engages with scholarship in environmental history and food studies, and his detailed treatment of the interactions between local villagers and central bureaucrats makes a valuable contribution to studies of state-society relations","subjects":["Agricultural innovations — History —","Agriculture and state — History —","Elite (Social sciences) — History —","Rice farming — History —"],"publisherName":"University of Hawaii Press,","publishedDate":"","resourceId":"8c3d5562-9af4-4cca-a881-bd4ac2bd6547"},{"title":"Revisiting Japan's restoration","subtitle":"new approaches to the study of the Meiji transformation","authors":[{"authorName":"Amos, Timothy D","roleTerm":"editor"},{"authorName":"Ishii, Akiko","roleTerm":"editor"},{"authorName":"Taylor & Francis","roleTerm":""}],"lcCallNumber":"DS881.3 .R48 2022","ddCallNumber":"952.03/1","isbn":"9781003207771","abstract":"","subjects":["Historiography","History — Japan — Restoration, 1853-1870","History — Historiography — Japan — Restoration, 1853-1870"],"publisherName":"Routledge","publishedDate":"2022","resourceId":"bd544529-a781-49a6-b93e-30fe5257d4e1"},{"title":"Modernism and Japanese culture","subtitle":"","authors":[{"authorName":"Starrs, Roy","roleTerm":"creator"}],"lcCallNumber":"DS822.25 .S73 2011","ddCallNumber":"952.03","isbn":"9780230346444 (pbk.)","abstract":"\"Offering an in-depth and comprehensive account of the complex history of Japanese modernism, in this book Roy Starrs considers the concept of modernism as encompassing not just the aesthetic avant-garde but a wide spectrum of social, political and cultural phenomena. He looks at Japanese modernism from the mid-19th century 'opening to the West' until the 21st-century, globalized world of 'postmodernism'; from the early Meiji 'cult of modernity' to the early Showa attempt to 'overcome modernity'. In this way, the book presents the history of Japanese modernism not as a straightforward, linear narrative of progressive acceptance and adaptation but more as a dialectical, back-and-forth oscillation between the two poles of acceptance and rejection, modernism and anti-modernism. Furthermore, Starrs shows that Japanese modernism was not simply the outcome of the passive reception of a unidirectional modern Western influence but of a complex cross-cultural interchange between East and West, modernity and tradition. In particular, he shows that traditional Japanese culture was very much part of that cultural mix, and a prime source of inspiration for modernists in both Japan and the West. Thus the book also convincingly demonstrates that Japan served as an active agent at certain key moments in the history of world modernism\"--","subjects":["Civilization, Modern","Modernism (Aesthetics) — History — Japan","History","History, Modern","Asia — History","Civilization — History","Social history","Literature, Modern — 20th century","Literature","Civilization — Japan — 1868-","Intellectual life — Japan — 1868-","Civilization — Western influences — Japan"],"publisherName":"Palgrave Macmillan","publishedDate":"2011","resourceId":"bc1e2618-2dda-4c16-a6de-96a410e9f199"},{"title":"Higashi Nihon Daishinsai tsunami shōsai chizu","subtitle":"","authors":[{"authorName":"Haraguchi, Tsuyoshi","roleTerm":"creator"},{"authorName":"Iwamatsu, Akira","roleTerm":""}],"lcCallNumber":"HV603 2011.T64 H37 2011","ddCallNumber":"","isbn":"9784772271127 (v. 1)","abstract":"","subjects":["Tohoku Earthquake and Tsunami, Japan, 2011 — Maps","Tsunami damage — Maps —","Tsunami hazard zones — Maps —","Floods — Maps —","Tsunami damage — History — Maps — — 21st century","Tsunami hazard zones — History — Maps — — 21st century","Floods — History — Maps — — 21st century","History — Maps — Tōhoku Region (Japan) — 21st century","History — Maps — Kantō Region (Japan) — 21st century","History — Maps — Pacific Coast (Japan) — 21st century"],"publisherName":"Kokon Shoin","publishedDate":"2011","resourceId":"b66131fe-5288-405a-b587-34bc1a49fc45"},{"title":"A curious madness","subtitle":"an American combat psychiatrist, a Japanese war crimes suspect, and an unsolved mystery from World War II","authors":[{"authorName":"Jaffe, Eric","roleTerm":"creator"}],"lcCallNumber":"DS885.5.O44 J34 2014","ddCallNumber":"952.04092 B","isbn":"9781451612059 (hbk.)","abstract":"\"From an 'illuminating and entertaining' (The New York Times) historian comes the World War II story of two men whose remarkable lives improbably converged at the Tokyo war crimes trials of 1946. In the wake of World War II, the Allied forces charged twenty-eight Japanese men with crimes against humanity. Correspondents at the Tokyo trial thought the evidence fell most heavily on ten of the accused. In December 1948, five of these defendants were hanged while four received sentences of life in prison. The tenth was a brilliant philosopher-patriot named Okawa Shumei. His story proved strangest of all. Among all the political and military leaders on trial, Okawa was the lone civilian. In the years leading up to World War II, he had outlined a divine mission for Japan to lead Asia against the West, prophesized a great clash with the United States, planned coups d'etat with military rebels, and financed the assassination of Japan's prime minister.^ Beyond 'all vestiges of doubt,' concluded a classified American intelligence report, 'Okawa moved in the best circles of nationalist intrigue.' Okawa's guilt as a conspirator appeared straightforward. But on the first day of the Tokyo trial, he made headlines around the world by slapping star defendant and wartime prime minister Tojo Hideki on the head. Had Okawa lost his sanity? Or was he faking madness to avoid a grim punishment? A U.S. Army psychiatrist stationed in occupied Japan, Major Daniel Jaffe--the author's grandfather--was assigned to determine Okawa's ability to stand trial, and thus his fate. Jaffe was no stranger to madness. He had seen it his whole life: in his mother, as a boy in Brooklyn; in soldiers, on the battlefields of Europe. Now his seasoned eye faced the ultimate test. If Jaffe deemed Okawa sane, the war crimes suspect might be hanged.^ But if Jaffe found Okawa insane, the philosopher patriot might escape justice for his role in promoting Japan's wartime aggression. Meticulously researched, A Curious Madness is both expansive in scope and vivid in detail. As the story pushes both Jaffe and Okawa toward their postwar confrontation, it explores such diverse topics as the roots of belligerent Japanese nationalism, the development of combat psychiatry during World War II, and the complex nature of postwar justice. Eric Jaffe is at his best in this suspenseful and engrossing historical narrative of the fateful intertwining of two men on different sides of the war and the world and the question of insanity\"--","subjects":["Politicians — Biography — Japan","Nationalists — Biography — Japan","Psychiatrists — Biography — United States","Insanity defense — History — — 20th century","War crime trials — History — — 20th century","World War, 1939-1945 — Biography","History — Biography — Japan — Allied occupation, 1945-1952"],"publisherName":"Scribner","publishedDate":"2014","resourceId":"e249ad63-7596-4ef9-8769-33a0f7156d34"},{"title":"Transnational Japan as history","subtitle":"empire, migration, and social movements","authors":[{"authorName":"Takahashi, Shinnosuke","roleTerm":"editor"},{"authorName":"Leary, Danton","roleTerm":"editor"},{"authorName":"Iacobelli, Pedro","roleTerm":"editor"}],"lcCallNumber":"DS885.2 .T73 2016","ddCallNumber":"327.52009/04","isbn":"9781137568779","abstract":"\"This volume looks at the history of Japan from a transnational perspective.

Constructing Empire shows how planners, architects, and civilians contributed? often enthusiastically? to constructing a modern colonial enclave in the Japanese puppet state of Manchuria. Japanese imperialism in Manchuria before 1931 developed in a manner similar to that of other imperialists elsewhere in China, but beginning in 1932 the Japanese sought to surpass their rivals by transforming the northeastern city of Changchun into a grand capital for the new client state of Manchukuo, putting it on the cutting edge of Japanese propaganda. Providing a thematic assessment of the evolving nature of planning, architecture, economy, and society in Changchun, Bill Sewell examines the key organizations involved in developing Japan?s empire there as part of larger efforts to assert its place in the world order.

This was a means of describing their wealth and sophistication, their willingness to trade with the West, and their presumed capacity to become Christianized. But by the end of the seventeenth century the category of whiteness was reserved for Europeans only. When and how did Asians become \"yellow\" in the Western imagination? Looking at the history of racial thinking, Becoming Yellow explores the notion of yellowness and shows that this label originated not in early travel texts or objective descriptions, but in the eighteenth- and nineteenth-century scientific discourses on race. From the walls of an ancient Egyptian tomb, which depicted people of varying skin tones including yellow, to the phrase \"yellow peril\" at the beginning of the twentieth century in Europe and America, Michael Keevak follows the development of perceptions about race and human difference. He indicates that the conceptual relationship between East Asians and yellow skin did not begin in Chinese culture or Western readings of East Asian cultural symbols, but in anthropological and medical records that described variations in skin color. Eighteenth-century taxonomers such as Carl Linnaeus, as well as Victorian scientists and early anthropologists, assigned colors to all racial groups, and once East Asians were lumped with members of the Mongolian race, they began to be considered yellow. Demonstrating how a racial distinction took root in Europe and traveled internationally, Becoming Yellow weaves together multiple narratives to tell the complex history of a problematic term","subjects":["East Asians — Race identity","National characteristics, East Asian","Race awareness — History — Western countries — 18th century","Race awareness — History — Western countries — 19th century","Racism — History — Western countires — 18th century","Racism — History — Western countires — 19th century"],"publisherName":"Princeton University Press","publishedDate":"c2011","resourceId":"56930d52-3573-4695-b4de-1acbec324413"},{"title":"Offspring of empire","subtitle":"the Koch'ang Kims and the colonial origins of Korean capitalism, 1876-1945","authors":[{"authorName":"Eckert, Carter J","roleTerm":"creator"}],"lcCallNumber":"HC466.5.A2 E25 2014","ddCallNumber":"338.9519009/041","isbn":"","abstract":"","subjects":["Businesspeople — History — Korea","Industrial policy — History — Korea","Capitalism — History — Korea","Dependency on Japan — History — Korea"],"publisherName":"University of Washington Press","publishedDate":"","resourceId":"ff00d138-95f8-428e-8540-652f203572da"},{"title":"Dark pasts","subtitle":"changing the state's story in Turkey and Japan","authors":[{"authorName":"Dixon, Jennifer M.

Despite persistent economic and social stresses, the country seemed to be approaching a new period of growth. The idea that the shogunate would not last forever was far from anyone's mind.Yet, in that year, an anonymous samurai author completed one of the most detailed critiques of Edo society known today. Writing as Buyo Inshi, \"a retired gentleman of Edo,\" he expresses a profound despair with the state of the realm and with people's behavior and attitudes. He sees decay wherever he turns and believes the world will soon descend into war.Buyo shows a familiarity with many corners of Edo life that one might not expect in a samurai. He describes the corruption of samurai officials; the suffering of the poor in villages and cities; the operation of brothels; the dealings of blind moneylenders; the selling and buying of temple abbotships; and the dubious strategies townspeople use in the law courts. Perhaps the frankness of his account, which contains a wealth of concrete information about Edo society, made him prefer to remain anonymous.This volume contains a full translation of Buyo's often-\"ed but rarely studied work by a team of specialists on Edo society.

In each encounter the Dutch were forced to retreat, compelled to abandon their claims to sovereign powers, and to refashion themselves again and again-from subjects of a fictive king to loyal vassals of the shogun, from aggressive pirates to meek merchants, and from insistent defenders of colonial sovereignty to legal subjects of the Tokugawa state. Within the confines of these conflicts, the terms of the relationship between the company and the shogun first took shape and were subsequently set into what would become their permanent form.

Earthquake Children is the first book to examine the origins of modern Japan's infrastructure of resilience. Drawing from a rich collection of previously unexplored sources, Janet Borland vividly illustrates that Japan's contemporary culture of disaster preparedness and its people's ability to respond calmly in a time of emergency are the result of learned and practiced behaviors. She traces their origins to the aftermath of the Great Kantō Earthquake, which killed over 100,000 people when it struck the Tokyo region in 1923. Beyond providing new perspectives on Japan's seismic past, the history of childhood, and everyday life in interwar Japan, this book challenges popular notions that Japanese people behave calmly whenever disaster strikes due to their innate qualities. Tokyo's traumatic experiences in 1923 convinced government officials, seismologists, teachers, physicians, and architects that Japan must better prepare for future disasters.

In that vibrant sound culture, the talkie was introduced on the radio before it could be heard in the cinema, and pop music adaptations substituted for musicals even as cinema musicians and live narrators resisted the introduction of recorded sound.

Visit www.luminosoa.org to learn more. Scholarly discussions on economic development in history, specifically those linked to industrialization or modern economic growth, have paid great attention to the formation and development of the market economy as a set of institutions able to augment people's welfare. The role of specific nonmarket practices for promoting the economic development and welfare has been a distinct concern, typically involving discussion of the state's economic policies. How have societies tackled those issues that the market did not? To what extent did those solutions reflect the structure of an economy? Public Goods Provision in the Early Modern Economy explores these questions by investigating efforts made for the provision of \";public goods\"; in early modern economies from the perspective of Japanese socioeconomic history during Tokugawa era (1603-1868), and by comparing those cases with others from Europe and China's economic history. The contributors focus on three areas of inquiry-early modern era welfare policies for the poor, infrastructure, and forest management-to provide both a unique perspective on Japanese public finance at local levels and a vantage point outside of Europe to encourage a more global view of early modern political economies that shaped subsequent modern transformations","subjects":["Public goods — History"],"publisherName":"University of California Press,","publishedDate":"","resourceId":"c7f01c00-5aa7-4d15-b96f-a7f8cd6c041c"},{"title":"Mobilizing Japanese youth","subtitle":"the Cold War and the making of the sixties generation","authors":[{"authorName":"Gerteis, Christopher","roleTerm":""},{"authorName":"Project Muse","roleTerm":""}],"lcCallNumber":"HN730.Z9 R3225 2021","ddCallNumber":"303.48/4","isbn":"9781501756337","abstract":"","subjects":["Youth — Political activity — History — Japan — 20th century","Radicalism — History — Japan — 20th century","Political violence — History — Japan — 20th century","Political alienation — History — Japan — 20th century","Political alienation","Political violence","Politics and government","Radicalism","Youth — Political activity","Politics and government — Japan — 1945-"],"publisherName":"Cornell University Press","publishedDate":"2021","resourceId":"48c29dcf-0253-4fe0-882e-24c83c3b9303"},{"title":"The decision to drop the bomb","subtitle":"","authors":[{"authorName":"Giovannitti, Len","roleTerm":"creator"},{"authorName":"Freed, Fred","roleTerm":"joint author"},{"authorName":"Chandler, Alfred D.

The state is undoubtedly the most important actor in the process of memory production and along with conservative legislators and the grass-root revisionist movement there has been a consistent failure to acknowledge responsibility for Japan's wartime past. However, to fully comprehend war memory in Japan, due attention must be paid to competing discourses that demand an alternative view, and only then can the true complexity of Japanese war memory and attitudes towards the legacies of the Asia-Pacific war be understood. The Politics of War Memory in Japan examines the involvement of five civil society actors in the struggle over remembering and addressing the wartime past in Japan today. In studying progressive war memory activists, it quickly becomes clear that the apologia by conservative politicians cannot be treated as representative of the opinion of the majority of the Japanese public. Indeed, this book seeks to remedy the disparity between studies devoted to the official level of addressing the 'history issue' and the grass-root historical revisionist movement on the one side, and progressive activism on the other. Furthermore, it contributes to scholarly debates on the state of civil society in Japan, challenging the characterisation of Japanese civil society as a depoliticised space by demonstrating a more contentious side of civil society activism\"--","subjects":["World War, 1939-1945 — Social aspects — Japan","War and society — History — Japan — 20th century","Collective memory — Japan","Nationalism and collective memory — Japan","Civil society — Japan"],"publisherName":"Routledge","publishedDate":"2014","resourceId":"1a288fe3-570a-4919-876f-f2907ddfc4f4"},{"title":"Maiden voyage","subtitle":"the Senzaimaru and the creation of modern Sino-Japanese relations","authors":[{"authorName":"Fogel, Joshua A","roleTerm":""}],"lcCallNumber":"HF1602.15.C6 F64 2014","ddCallNumber":"382/.95105209034","isbn":"9780520283305 (hardback)","abstract":"\" After centuries of virtual isolation, during which time international sea travel was forbidden outside of Japan's immediate fishing shores, Japanese shogunal authorities in 1862 made the unprecedented decision to launch an official delegation to China by sea. Concerned by the fast-changing global environment, they had witnessed the ever-increasing number of incursions into Asia by European powers-not the least of which was Commodore Perry's arrival in Japan in 1853-54 and the forced opening of a handful of Japanese ports at the end of the decade. The Japanese reasoned that it was only a matter of time before they too encountered the same unfortunate fate as China; their hope was to learn from the Chinese experience and to keep foreign powers at bay. They dispatched the Senzaimaru to Shanghai with the purpose of investigating contemporary conditions of trade and diplomacy in the international city.^ Japanese from varied domains, as well as shogunal officials, Nagasaki merchants, and an assortment of deck hands, made the voyage along with a British crew, spending a total of ten weeks observing and interacting with the Chinese and with a handful of Westerners. Roughly a dozen Japanese narratives of the voyage were produced at the time, recounting personal impressions and experiences in Shanghai. The Japanese emissaries had the distinct advantage of being able to communicate with their Chinese hosts by means of the \"brush conversation\" (written exchanges in literary Chinese). For their part, the Chinese authorities also created a paper trail of reports and memorials concerning the Japanese visitors, which worked its way up and down the bureaucratic chain of command. This was the first official meeting of Chinese and Japanese in several centuries.^ Although the Chinese authorities agreed to few of the Japanese requests for trade relations and a consulate, nine years later China and Japan would sign the first bilateral treaty of amity in their history, a completely equal treaty.

After their father's death, Harry, Frank, and Pierce Fukuhara-- all born and raised in the Pacific Northwest-- moved to Hiroshima, their mother's ancestral home. Eager to go back to America, Harry returned in the late 1930s. Then came Pearl Harbor. Harry was sent to an internment camp until a call came for Japanese translators and he dutifully volunteered to serve his country. Back in Hiroshima, his brothers Frank and Pierce became soldiers in the Japanese Imperial Army. As the war raged on, Harry, one of the finest bilingual interpreters in the United States Army, island-hopped across the Pacific, moving ever closer to the enemy--^ and to his younger brothers. But before the Fukuharas would have to face each other in battle, the U.S. detonated the atomic bomb over Hiroshima, gravely injuring tens of thousands of civilians, including members of their family. Alternating between the American and Japanese perspectives, Midnight in Broad Daylight captures the uncertainty and intensity of those charged with the fighting as well as the deteriorating home front of Hiroshima-- as never seen before in English--^ and provides a fresh look at the dropping of the first atomic bomb. Intimate and evocative, it is an indelible portrait of a resilient family, a scathing examination of racism and xenophobia, an homage to the tremendous Japanese American contribution to the American war effort, and an invaluable addition to the historical record of this extraordinary time; ''Mother, I am Katsuharu. I have come home.' By the time the reader arrives at this simple, Odysseus-like declaration, she will have been tossed and transported through one of the most wrenching, inspirational-- and until now unknown-- true epics of World War II.

Fortunately for all those interested in uncovering the origins of Japanese civilization, archaeologists have been hard at work.

Once one of the most prosperous ports in the country, Kaminoseki fell into profound economic decline following Japan's reengagement with the West in the late nineteenth century. Using a recently discovered archive and oral histories collected during his years of research in Kaminoseki, Martin Dusinberre reconstructs the lives of households and townspeople as they tried to make sense of their changing place in the world. In challenging the familiar story of modern Japanese growth, Dusinberre provides important new insights into how ordinary people shaped the development of the modern state.Chapters describe the role of local revolutionaries in the Meiji Restoration of 1868, the ways townspeople grasped opportunities to work overseas in the late nineteenth century, and the impact this pan-Pacific diaspora community had on Kaminoseki during the prewar decades. These histories amplify Dusinberre's analysis of postwar rural decline-a phenomenon found not only in Japan but throughout the industrialized Western world. His account comes to a climax when, in the 1980s, the town's councillors request the construction of a nuclear power station, unleashing a storm of protests from within the community. This ongoing nuclear dispute has particular resonance in the wake of the 2011 Fukushima crisis.Hard Times in the Hometown gives voice to personal histories otherwise lost in abandoned archives.

To understand the triumph of the tea plant in Japan, William Wayne Farris begins with its cultivation and goes on to describe the myriad ways in which the herb was processed into a palatable beverage, ultimately resulting in the wide variety of teas we enjoy today. Along the way, he traces in fascinating detail the shift in tea's status from exotic gift item from China, tied to Heian (794-1185) court ritual and medicinal uses, to tax and commodity for exchange in the 1350s, to its complete nativization in Edo (1603-1868) art and literature and its eventual place on the table of every Japanese household.Farris maintains that the increasing sophistication of Japanese agriculture after 1350 is exemplified by tea farming, which became so advanced that Meiji (1868-1912) entrepreneurs were able to export significant amounts of Japanese tea to Euro-American markets. This in turn provided the much-needed foreign capital necessary to help secure Japan a place among the world's industrialized nations. Tea also had a hand in initiating Japan's \"industrious revolution\": From 1400, tea was being drunk in larger quantities by commoners as well as elites, and the stimulating, habit-forming beverage made it possible for laborers to apply handicraft skills in a meticulous, efficient, and prolonged manner. In addition to aiding in the protoindustrialization of Japan by 1800, tea had by that time become a central commodity in the formation of a burgeoning consumer society. The demand-pull of tea consumption necessitated even greater production into the postwar period-and this despite challenges posed to the industry by consumers' growing taste for coffee. A Bowl for a Coin makes a convincing case for how tea-an age-old drink that continues to adapt itself to changing tastes in Japan and the world-can serve as a broad lens through which to view the development of Japanese society over many centuries","subjects":["History of Asia","History"],"publisherName":"University of Hawaii Press,","publishedDate":"","resourceId":"4cc6344d-ae9c-49d9-8c58-4d9cdce86a9b"},{"title":"Health insurance politics in Japan","subtitle":"policy development, government, and the Japan Medical Association","authors":[{"authorName":"Yamagishi, Takakazu","roleTerm":""},{"authorName":"Project Muse","roleTerm":""}],"lcCallNumber":"RA395.J3 Y34 2022","ddCallNumber":"368.38/200952","isbn":"9781501763519","abstract":"","subjects":["Political activity","Medical care — Political aspects — Japan","Health insurance — Government policy — Japan","Medical policy — History — Japan — 20th century","Medical policy — History — Japan — 21st century","Health insurance — Government policy","Medical care — Political aspects","Medical policy","Political participation"],"publisherName":"ILR Press, an imprint of Cornell University Press","publishedDate":"2022","resourceId":"8e39aeeb-eddb-4444-a755-72bb323ba7f8"},{"title":"Inglorious, illegal bastards","subtitle":"Japan's self-defense force during the Cold War","authors":[{"authorName":"Skabelund, Aaron Herald","roleTerm":""},{"authorName":"Project Muse","roleTerm":""}],"lcCallNumber":"UA845 .S6115 2022","ddCallNumber":"355.033052","isbn":"9781501764387","abstract":"","subjects":["Cold War — Influence","Armed Forces","War — Influence","Armed Forces — History — Japan — 20th century","History, Military — Japan — 1945-"],"publisherName":"Cornell University Press","publishedDate":"2022","resourceId":"b9c77873-ff33-4754-bebe-76e3f94d6654"},{"title":"Japan's Commission on the Constitution","subtitle":"The Final Report","authors":[{"authorName":"Japan Kempo Chosakai","roleTerm":""},{"authorName":"Maki, John M.

Engaging both the history of children and childhood and the history of emotions, contributors to this volume track Japanese childhood through a number of historical scenarios. Such explorations--some from Japan's early-modern past--are revealed through letters, diaries, memoirs, family and household records, and religious polemics about promising, rambunctious, sickly, happy, and dutiful youngsters.\"--Provided by publisher","subjects":["Parent and child — History — Japan","Education — History — Japan","Children — Social conditions — Japan","Children — History — Japan","Social conditions — Japan"],"publisherName":"University of California Press","publishedDate":"[2017]","resourceId":"8a291d77-58ef-458a-904d-ba3b27960627"},{"title":"The Portuguese slave trade in early modern Japan","subtitle":"merchants, Jesuits and Japanese, Chinese, and Korean slaves","authors":[{"authorName":"Sousa, Lúcio de","roleTerm":""}],"lcCallNumber":"HT1276 .S683 2019","ddCallNumber":"306.3/62095209031","isbn":"9789004365803","abstract":"\"In The Portuguese Slave Trade in Early Modern Japan: Merchants, Jesuits and Japanese, Chinese, and Korean Slaves Lucio de Sousa offers a study on the system of traffic of Japanese, Chinese, and Korean slaves from Japan, using the Portuguese mercantile networks; reconstructs the Japanese communities in the Habsburg Empire; and analyses the impact of the Japanese slave trade on the Iberian legislation produced in the 16th and first half of the 17th centuries\"--","subjects":["Slave trade — History — Japan — 16th century","Slave trade — History — Japan — 17th century","Slave trade — History — Portugal — 16th century","Slave trade — History — Portugal — 17th century","Slave trade"],"publisherName":"Brill","publishedDate":"","resourceId":"796d3692-966e-4441-96b2-961c77f6b0e3"},{"title":"From confinement to containment","subtitle":"Japanese/American arts during the early Cold War","authors":[{"authorName":"Tang, Edward","roleTerm":""}],"lcCallNumber":"NX512.3.J32 T36 2019","ddCallNumber":"704.03/956073","isbn":"9781439917480","abstract":"\"From Confinement to Containment examines four Japanese and Japanese American artists--the novelist Hanama Tasaki, the actor Yamaguchi Yoshiko, the painter Henry Sugimoto, and the children's author Yoshiko Uchida--whose lives and work explored overlapping transpacific legacies of immigration, imperialism, confinement, and global conflict in U.S.-Japan relations\"--","subjects":["Japanese American art — Themes, motives — 20th century","Arts, Japanese — Themes, motives — 20th century","Arts and society — History — United States — 20th century","Arts and society — History — Japan — 20th century","Arts and society","Arts, Japanese — Themes, motives"],"publisherName":"Temple University Press","publishedDate":"2019","resourceId":"ed3214cb-81f9-4242-a733-9c80ffb03402"},{"title":"Thought crime","subtitle":"ideology and state power in interwar Japan","authors":[{"authorName":"Ward, Max M","roleTerm":""},{"authorName":"e-Duke books scholarly collection","roleTerm":""}],"lcCallNumber":"KNX4438 .W37 2019","ddCallNumber":"345.52/023109042","isbn":"9781478002741","abstract":"In Thought Crime Max M.

To enforce the law, the government enlisted a number of nonstate actors, who included monks, family members, and community leaders. Throughout, Ward illuminates the complex processes through which the law articulated imperial ideology and how this ideology was transformed and disseminated through the law's application over its twenty-year history. In so doing, he shows how the Peace Preservation Law provides a window into understanding how modern states develop ideological apparatuses to subject their respective populations.--","subjects":["Lese majesty — Law and legislation — History — Japan — 20th century","Political crimes and offenses — History — Japan — 20th century","Lese majesty — Law and legislation","Political crimes and offenses","Politics and government","Politics and government — Japan — 1926-1945","Politics and government — Japan — 1912-1945","History — Japan — 1912-1945"],"publisherName":"Duke University Press","publishedDate":"2019","resourceId":"3caa43d4-54e2-4a69-b441-6fda171c6596"},{"title":"The greater east Asia co-prosperity sphere","subtitle":"when total empire met total war","authors":[{"authorName":"Yellen, Jeremy A","roleTerm":""},{"authorName":"Project Muse","roleTerm":""}],"lcCallNumber":"DS889.5 .Y45 2019","ddCallNumber":"940.53/5","isbn":"9781501735561","abstract":"","subjects":["International relations","History — Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere","Relations —","History — Japan — 20th century"],"publisherName":"Cornell University Press","publishedDate":"2019","resourceId":"63b16a86-6936-44d2-b3d9-8afbd78ee1d8"},{"title":"Race to Pearl Harbor","subtitle":"The Failure of the Second London Naval Conference and the Onset of World War II","authors":[{"authorName":"Pelz, Stephen E","roleTerm":""}],"lcCallNumber":"","ddCallNumber":"","isbn":"9780674863521","abstract":"","subjects":[],"publisherName":"Harvard University Press,","publishedDate":"","resourceId":"db97f299-752a-4fc7-b076-e4900f848ff2"},{"title":"Japan's Protoindustrial Elite","subtitle":"The Economic Foundations of the Gōnō","authors":[{"authorName":"Pratt, Edward","roleTerm":""}],"lcCallNumber":"HN730.Z9","ddCallNumber":"305.5/2/095209034","isbn":"1-68417-327-2","abstract":"","subjects":["Japan — Social conditions — 1868-","Elite (Social sciences) — History — Japan — 19th century","Landowners — History — Japan — 19th century","Merchants — History — Japan — 19th century","Rural industries — History — Case studies — Japan — 19th century","Social conditions — Japan — 1868-"],"publisherName":"Harvard University Asia Center","publishedDate":"1999","resourceId":"bb628e8e-1261-4e24-8bf6-780ccc9e25b5"},{"title":"Disruptions of daily life","subtitle":"Japanese literary modernism in the world","authors":[{"authorName":"Mitchell, Arthur M","roleTerm":""},{"authorName":"Project Muse","roleTerm":""}],"lcCallNumber":"PL747.57.M577 M58 2020","ddCallNumber":"895.609/112","isbn":"9781501752933","abstract":"","subjects":["Japanese literature — History and criticism — TaishoÌ period, 1912-1926","Japanese literature — History and criticism — ShoÌwa period, 1926-1989","Modernism (Literature) — Japan","Literature and society — History — Japan — 20th century","Japanese literature — ShoÌwa period","Japanese literature — TaishoÌ period","Literature and society","Modernism (Literature)"],"publisherName":"Cornell East Asia Series, an imprint of Cornell University Press","publishedDate":"","resourceId":"8eace10a-a77c-4fad-ab94-c4067c5ed0ca"},{"title":"Land of Plants in Motion","subtitle":"Japanese Botany and the World","authors":[{"authorName":"Havens, Thomas R.

Early modern scientists in Japan drew on knowledge of Chinese herbal medicine but achieved distinctive insights into plant life commensurate with but separate from their European counterparts. Scholars at the University of Tokyo pioneered Japanese plant biology in the late nineteenth century. They incorporated Western botanical methods but sought a degree of difference in taxonomy while also gaining international legitimacy through publications in English. Japan’s age of empire (1895–1945) was less about plant exploration and more about plant collection, for both scientific and economic benefits. Displays of species from throughout the empire made Japan’s sphere of colonization and conquest visible at home. The infrastructure for research and instruction expanded slowly after World War Two: new laboratories, botanical gardens, scholarly societies, and publications eventually allowed for great diversity of specialized study, especially with the growth of molecular biology in the 1970s and DNA research in the 1980s.

Using a rich array of source material, J. Charles Schencking tells for the first time the graphic tale of Tokyo's destruction and rebirth. In emotive prose, he documents how the citizens of Tokyo experienced this unprecedented calamity and explores the ways in which it rattled people's deep-seated anxieties about modernity. While explaining how and why the disaster compelled people to reflect on Japanese society, he also examines how reconstruction encouraged the capital's inhabitants to entertain new types of urbanism as they rebuilt their world. Some residents hoped that a grandiose metropolis, reflecting new values, would rise from the ashes of disaster-ravaged Tokyo. Many, however, desired a quick return of the city they once called home. Opportunistic elites advocated innovative state infrastructure to better manage the daily lives of Tokyo residents. Others focused on rejuvenating society -- morally, economically, and spiritually -- to combat the perceived degeneration of Japan. Schencking explores the inspiration behind these dreams and the extent to which they were realized. He investigates why Japanese citizens from all walks of life responded to overtures for renewal with varying degrees of acceptance, ambivalence, and resistance. His research not only sheds light on Japan's experience with and interpretation of the earthquake but challenges widespread assumptions that disasters unite stricken societies, creating a \"blank slate\" for radical transformation. National reconstruction in the wake of the Great Kanto Earthquake, Schencking demonstrates, proved to be illusive. -- Book jacket","subjects":["Kanto Earthquake, Japan, 1923","Disaster relief — Government policy — History — Japan — 20th century","City planning — Social aspects — History — — 20th century","History — Tokyo (Japan) — 20th century"],"publisherName":"Columbia University Press","publishedDate":"","resourceId":"0b6f35b7-35bb-48ac-905a-100b0d5e419e"},{"title":"Minna no ie, sono saki e","subtitle":"Home-for-all and beyond","authors":[{"authorName":"Itō, Toyoo","roleTerm":""}],"lcCallNumber":"HV555.J3 I86 2018","ddCallNumber":"","isbn":"9784864800334","abstract":"","subjects":["Rest centers (Disaster relief) — History — — 21st century","Tohoku Earthquake and Tsunami, Japan, 2011","Earthquakes — History — — 21st century"],"publisherName":"LIXIL Shuppan","publishedDate":"2018","resourceId":"95d95105-98f1-424b-9a05-bf4c7f11e19e"},{"title":"Prisoners from Nambu","subtitle":"Reality and Make-Believe in 17th-Century Japanese Diplomacy","authors":[{"authorName":"Hesselink, Reinier H","roleTerm":""}],"lcCallNumber":"DS871.7 .H47 2002eb","ddCallNumber":"952/.1","isbn":"0-8248-6402-6","abstract":"On July 29, 1643, ten crew members of the Dutch yacht Breskens were lured ashore at Nambu in northern Japan. Once out of view of their ship, the men were bound and taken to the shogun, Tokugawa Iemitsu, in Edo, where they remained imprisoned for four months. Later the Japanese government forced the Dutch East India Company representative in Nagasaki to acknowledge that the sailors had in fact been saved from shipwreck and that official recognition of the rescue (i.e., a formal visit from a Dutch ambassador) was in order. Prisoners from Nambu provides a lively, engrossing narrative of this relatively obscure incident, while casting light on the history of the period as a whole. Expertly constructing his tale from primary sources, the author examines relations between the Dutch East India Company and the shogunal government immediately following the promulgation of the \"seclusion laws\" (sakokurei) and anti-Christian campaigns","subjects":["Foreign relations — Japan — 1600-1868","Foreign relations — East Asia","Foreign relations —"],"publisherName":"University of Hawaii Press,","publishedDate":"","resourceId":"27408f92-849c-4600-878d-d94ce9286880"},{"title":"Economic and Demographic Change in Preindustrial Japan, 1600-1868","subtitle":"","authors":[{"authorName":"Hanley, Susan B","roleTerm":""},{"authorName":"Yamamura, Kozo","roleTerm":"author"}],"lcCallNumber":"HC462.6","ddCallNumber":"330.9/52/025","isbn":"0-691-61650-7","abstract":"According to the Marxist interpretation still dominant in Japanese studies, the last century and a half of the Tokugawa period was a time of economic and demographic stagnation. Professors Hanley and Yamamura argue that a more satisfactory explanation can be provided within the framework of modem economic theory, and they advance and test three important new hypotheses in this book.The authors suggest that the Japanese economy grew throughout the Tokugawa period, though slowly by modern standards and unevenly. This growth, they show, tended to exceed the rate of population increase even in the poorer regions, thus raising the living standard despite major famines. Population growth was controlled by a variety of methods, including abortion and infanticide, for the primary purpose of raising the standard of living. Contrary to the prevailing view of scholars, thus, the conclusions advanced here indicate that the basis for Japan's rapid industrialization in the Meiji period was in many ways already established during the latter part of the Tokugawa period.

How are activists changed and movements transformed when they reach out to others a world away? This adept study addresses these questions by tying together local, national, regional, and global historical narratives surrounding the contemporary Japanese environmental movement. Spanning the era of Japanese industrial pollution in the 1960s and the more recent rise of movements addressing global environmental problems, it shows how Japanese activists influenced approaches to environmentalism and industrial pollution in the Asia-Pacific region, North America, and Europe, as well as landmark United Nations conferences in 1972 and 1992. Japan's experiences with diseases caused by industrial pollution produced a potent \"environmental injustice paradigm\" that fueled domestic protest and became the motivation for Japanese groups' activism abroad. From the late 1960s onward Japanese activists organized transnational movements addressing mercury contamination in Europe and North America, industrial pollution throughout East Asia, radioactive waste disposal in the Pacific, and global climate change. In all cases, they advocated strongly for the rights of pollution victims and people living in marginalized communities and nations-a position that often put them at odds with those advocating for the global environment over local or national rights. Transnational involvement profoundly challenged Japanese groups' understanding of and approach to activism. Numerous case studies demonstrate how border-crossing efforts undermined deeply engrained notions of victimhood in the domestic movement and nurtured a more self-reflexive and multidimensional approach to environmental problems and social activism.Transnational Japan in the Global Environmental Movement will appeal to scholars and students interested in the development of civil society, social movements, and environmentalism in contemporary Japan; grassroots inter-Asian connections in the postwar period; and the ways Asian countries and their citizens have shaped and been influenced by global issues like environmentalism","subjects":["Environmental protection — History — Japan","Environmentalism — History — Japan","Green movement — History — Japan"],"publisherName":"University of Hawaiʻi Press","publishedDate":"","resourceId":"992ba0a5-5065-4d4d-8088-a966a55d74f1"},{"title":"Investigating Iwo","subtitle":"the flag raisings in myth, memory, & esprit de corps","authors":[{"authorName":"Robertson, Breanne","roleTerm":"editor"},{"authorName":"Marine Corps University (U.S.)","roleTerm":"issuing body"}],"lcCallNumber":"D810.P4 I58 2019","ddCallNumber":"940.54/2528","isbn":"9781732003071","abstract":"\"Investigating Iwo encourages us to explore the connection between American visual culture and World War II, particularly how the image inspired Marines, servicemembers, and civilians to carry on with the war and to remember those who made the ultimate sacrifice to ensure victory over the Axis Powers.

True, it freed the Japanese press from many wartime constraints. But at the same time, it imposed a large number of new constraints, replacing wartime censorship by the Japanese government with postwar censorship by the American occupation authority. Even before the war ended, planning for the occupation included a censorship and public relations effort that would work to \"re-educate\" the Japanese and fold them into the postwar American international order. Similar efforts were made in Germany, but the effort in Japan was far more sweeping and far more sustained. This book documents that history in detail with extensive references to primary resources held in U.S. archives and elsewhere. Was the occupation successful in reshaping the Japanese mindset? Citing not only the postwar Constitution but also, among other things, the widespread belief in the Tokyo Trials' validity, Etō argues doggedly that it was so successful that its pernicious influence persists even today. Yet the heart of this heavily researched book is its meticulous documentation of how this censorship was planned and enforced.\"--","subjects":["Freedom of the press — History — Japan","Censorship — History — Japan","Tokyo Trial, Tokyo, Japan, 1946-1948","Postwar reconstruction — Japan","Diplomatic relations","Censorship","Freedom of the press","Politics and government","Postwar reconstruction","Politics and government — Japan — 1945-1989","History — Japan — Allied occupation, 1945-1952","Foreign relations —"],"publisherName":"Japan Publishing Industry Foundation for Culture (JPIC)","publishedDate":"2020","resourceId":"cc66c117-a272-42a8-bf42-a67fc321a64c"},{"title":"Towards Japan","subtitle":"a personal journey","authors":[{"authorName":"Stockwin, J.

Okinawa's most insightful writers and social critics Medoruma Shun's experience and identity as the child of two survivors of the Battle of Okinawa have powerfully shaped his understanding of the war and his literary craft. Further, through his groundbreaking and prize-winning fiction, editorials, essays, and speaking engagements, Shun has highlighted the problems and limits of conventional representation of the Battle of Okinawa, raised new questions and concerns about the nature of Okinawan war memory, and expanded the possibilities of representing war. This book examines Okinawan war memory through the lens of Medoruma's war fiction, and pays particular attention to the issues of second-generation war survivorship and transgenerational trauma. It explores how his texts contribute to knowledge about the war and its ongoing effects -- on survivors, their offspring, and the larger community -- in different ways from that of other modes of representation, such as survivor testimony, historical narrative, and realistic fiction. These dominant means of memory making have played a major role in shaping the various discourses about the war and the Battle of Okinawa, yet these forms of public memory and knowledge often exclude or avoid more personal, emotional, and traumatic experiences. Indeed, Ikeda's analysis sheds light on the nature of trauma on survivors and their children who continue to inhabit sites of the traumatic past, and in turn makes an important contribution to studies on trauma and second-generation survivor experiences\"--","subjects":["Criticism and interpretation","World War, 1939-1945 — Literature and the war","World War, 1939-1945 — Campaigns —","War in literature","Psychic trauma in literature","Collective memory in literature","In literature — Okinawa-ken (Japan)"],"publisherName":"Routledge","publishedDate":"2014","resourceId":"0fa8bc41-df7e-4a7c-a99c-5d381f460c25"},{"title":"The ultimate wish","subtitle":"ending the nuclear age = Negai","authors":[{"authorName":"Richter, Robert","roleTerm":""},{"authorName":"Richter Productions","roleTerm":"production company"},{"authorName":"New Day Films","roleTerm":"production company"}],"lcCallNumber":"U264.5.J3 U68 2012x","ddCallNumber":"355.0217","isbn":"9781574484816","abstract":"The moving, unforgettable stories of Nagasaki and Fukushima survivors.

The road was officially established in 1602, but ancient records show that it has been in use since at least 701, probably by merchants and hunters. In the seventeenth century, the road was a route for the daimyo (warlords) to travel on their biennial trips--along with their samurai and porters--to the new capital of Edo (now Tokyo). The natural beauty of the route is renowned--and famously inspired a series of woodblock prints by the artist Hiroshige. Walking the Kiso Road is a window into old Japan, and Wilson shares its rich history and lore, literary and artistic significance, cuisine and architecture. Wilson is a delightful and expert guide. His storytelling ability; vast knowledge of Japanese history, literature, and culture; and warm and readable writing style make this a book that will be treasured as much by armchair travelers as by tourists\"--","subjects":["Travel —","Description and travel — Nakasendō (Japan)","History — Nakasendō (Japan)","Social life and customs — Nakasendō (Japan)"],"publisherName":"Shambhala","publishedDate":"2015","resourceId":"d8695501-f5bf-4cf1-b6d9-2e477f0f9a4e"},{"title":"1910-yŏn Han'guk kangje pyŏnghap, kŭ yŏksa wa kwaje","subtitle":"Han-Il Kangje Pyŏnghap 100-yŏn Chaejomyŏng Kukche Haksul Hoeŭi = International conference on Japan's forced annexation of Korea in 1910, its history and tasks : agendas relating to the forced annexation of Korea by Japan","authors":[{"authorName":"Han-Il Kangje Pyŏnghap 100-yŏn Chaejomyŏng Kukche Haksul Hoeŭi (2010 : Seoul, Korea)","roleTerm":"creator"},{"authorName":"Tongbuga Yŏksa Chaedan (Korea)","roleTerm":""},{"authorName":"동북아역사재단 (Korea)","roleTerm":""}],"lcCallNumber":"JZ1750.A57 J3 2010c","ddCallNumber":"","isbn":"","abstract":"","subjects":["Foreign relations —","Foreign relations — Korea — 1864-1910","Foreign relations — Japan — 1868-1912","Annexation to Japan — Korea","History — Korea — Japanese occupation, 1910-1945","History — East Asia"],"publisherName":"Tongbuga Yŏksa Chaedan","publishedDate":"2010","resourceId":"f64ca8ea-1ed7-425d-a465-13667879c7e5"},{"title":"Risovatʹ lagerʹ","subtitle":"i︠a︡zyk travmy v pami︠a︡ti i︠a︡ponskikh voennoplennykh o SSSR","authors":[{"authorName":"Guchinova, Ė.-B","roleTerm":""}],"lcCallNumber":"D805.S65 G85 2016","ddCallNumber":"","isbn":"9784938637873","abstract":"\"This monograph is devoted to the way traumatic experience is reflected in drawings and creates the language of trauma.

Who are its people? These questions are among those addressed in Bruce Batten's ambitious study of Japan's historical development through the nineteenth century. Traditionally, Japan has been portrayed as a homogenous society formed over millennia in virtual isolation. Social historians and others have begun to question this view, emphasizing diversity and interaction, both within the Japanese archipelago and between Japan and other parts of Eurasia. Until now, however, no book has attempted to resolve these conflicting views in a comprehensive, systematic way. To the Ends of Japan tackles the \"big questions\" on Japan by focusing on its borders, broadly defined to include historical frontiers and boundaries within the islands themselves as well as the obvious coastlines and oceans. Batten provides compelling arguments for viewing borders not as geographic \"givens,\" but as social constructs whose location and significance can, and do, change over time. By giving separate treatment to the historical development of political, cultural, and ethnic borders in the archipelago, he highlights the complex, multifaceted nature of Japanese society, without losing sight of the more fundamental differences that have separated Japan from its nearest neighbors in the archipelago and on the Eurasian continent","subjects":["History — Japan"],"publisherName":"University of Hawaii Press","publishedDate":"","resourceId":"ccbbde22-a73a-4bc7-aae4-2231aea13fb0"},{"title":"アジア経済 [[アジアケイザイ]]","subtitle":"","authors":[{"authorName":"Ajia Keizai Kenkyūjo (Japan)","roleTerm":""},{"authorName":"アジア経済研究所 (Japan)","roleTerm":""}],"lcCallNumber":"HC411 .A53","ddCallNumber":"","isbn":"","abstract":"","subjects":["Economic history — Periodicals — 1945-","Economic history","Economic conditions — Periodicals — Asia — 1945-"],"publisherName":"Ajia Keizai Kenkyūjo","publishedDate":"1960-","resourceId":"55ccbafc-d0a8-4a0a-a909-9edcd4878512"},{"title":"Evaluating Evidence","subtitle":"A Positivist Approach to Reading Sources on Modern Japan","authors":[{"authorName":"Akita, George","roleTerm":""}],"lcCallNumber":"DS881.95 .A35 2008eb","ddCallNumber":"952.04072","isbn":"0-8248-6932-X","abstract":"Evaluating Evidence is based on the grueling lessons learned by a senior scholar during three decades of tutoring by, and collaboration with, Japanese historians. George Akita persisted in the difficult task of reading documentary sources in Japanese, most written in calligraphic style (sôsho), out of the conviction of their centrality to the historian's craft and his commitment to a positivist methodology to research and scholarship. He argues forcefully in this volume for an inductive process in which the scholar seeks out facts on a subject and, through observation and examination of an extensive body of data, is able to discern patterns until it is possible to formulate certain propositions. In his introduction, Akita relates how and why he decided to adopt a positivist approach and explains what he means by the term as it applies to humanistic studies. He enumerates the difficulties linked with reading primary sources in Japanese by looking at a variety of unpublished and published materials and identifying a major problem in reading published primary sources: the intervention of editors and compilers. He illustrates the pitfalls of such intervention by comparing the recently published seventeen-volume diary of Prime Minister Hara Takashi (1856-1921), a photo reproduction of the diary in Hara's own hand, and an earlier published version. Using documents related to Yamagata Aritomo (1838-1922), a figure of central importance in Japan's post-Restoration political history, he demonstrates the use of published and transcribed primary sources to sustain, question, or strengthen some of the themes and approaches adopted by non-Japanese scholars working on modern Japanese history. He ends his inquiry with two \"case studies,\" examining closely the methods of the highly acclaimed American historians John W. Dower and Herbert P.

Until about the fifteenth century, it was also among the world's largest cities and, as the eastern terminus of the Silk Road, it was a place where the political, artistic, and religious currents of Asia coalesced and flourished. Despite these and many other traits that make Kyoto a place of both Japanese and world historical significance, the physical appearance of the premodern city remains largely unknown. Through a synthesis of textual, pictorial, and archeological sources, this work attempts to shed light on Kyoto's premodern urban landscape with the aim of opening up new ways of thinking about key aspects of premodern Japanese history. The book begins with an examination of Kyoto's highly idealized urban plan (adapted from Chinese models in the eighth century) and the reasons behind its eventual failure. The formation of the suburbs of Kamigyō and Shimogyō is compared to the creation of large exurban temple-palace complexes by retired emperors from the late eleventh century. Each, it is argued, was a material manifestation of the advancement of privatized power that inspired a medieval discourse aimed at excluding \"outsiders.\" By examining this discourse, a case is made that medieval power holders, despite growing autonomy, continued to see the emperor and classical state system as the ultimate sources of political legitimacy. This sentiment was shared by the leaders of the Ashikaga shogunate, who established their headquarters in Kyoto in 1336. The narrative examines how these warrior leaders interacted with the capital's urban landscape, revealing a surprising degree of deference to classical building protocols and urban codes. Remaining chapters look at the dramatic changes that took place during the Age of Warring States (1467-1580s) and Kyoto's postwar revitalization under the leadership of Oda Nobunaga and Toyotomi Hideyoshi. Nobunaga's construction of Nijō Castle in 1569 transformed Kyoto's fundamental character and, as Japan's first castle town, it set an example soon replicated throughout the archipelago. In closing, the book explores how Hideyoshi-like so many before him, yet with much greater zeal-used monumentalism to co-opt and leverage the authority of Kyoto's traditional institutions. Richly illustrated with original maps and diagrams, Kyoto is a panoramic examination of space and architecture spanning eight centuries. It narrates a history of Japan's premodern capital relevant to the fields of institutional history, material culture, art and architectural history, religion, and urban planning. Students and scholars of Japan will be introduced to new ways of thinking about old historical problems while readers interested in the cities and architecture of East Asia and beyond will benefit from a novel approach that synthesizes a wide variety of sources.For more on Kyoto: An Urban History of Japan's Premodern Capital, visit www.kyotohistory.com","subjects":["History — Kyoto (Japan)"],"publisherName":"University of Hawaii Press,","publishedDate":"","resourceId":"02330bd8-f209-4a83-b993-cb8dbe2da6d7"},{"title":"The Ryukyu Kingdom","subtitle":"Cornerstone of East Asia","authors":[{"authorName":"Akamine, Mamoru","roleTerm":""},{"authorName":"Huey, Robert","roleTerm":"editor"},{"authorName":"Terrell, Lina J","roleTerm":""}],"lcCallNumber":"DS895.R95 A3713 2017eb","ddCallNumber":"952/.2902","isbn":"0-8248-7295-9","abstract":"This English translation of a key work by one of Okinawa's most respected historians, Mamoru Akamine, provides a compelling new picture of the role played by the Ryukyu Kingdom in the history of East Asia. Okinawa Island, from which the present-day Japanese prefecture derives its name, is the largest of the Ryukyu Islands, an archipelago that stretches between Japan and Taiwan. In the present volume, Akamine chronicles the rise of the Ryukyu Kingdom in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, when it played a major part in East Asian trade and diplomacy. Then Ryukyu was indeed the cornerstone in a vibrant East Asian trade sphere centered on Ming China, linking what we now call Japan, Korea, and China to Southeast Asia. With historical and cultural connections to both Japan and China, Ryukyu also mediated diplomatically between the two nations, whose leaders more often than not refused to deal with each other directly. But eventually the kingdom became a victim of its own success. Political developments in China and Japan starting in the sixteenth century brought great changes to the region, and in 1609 Ryukyu was invaded by Satsuma, Japan's southernmost domain. The China-Japan geopolitical rivalry would in time be acted out within Ryukyu itself, as one faction strove to maintain ties with China while another supported union with rapidly modernizing Japan. Throughout the work Akamine's approach to Ryukyu history is distinguished by his expert use of Chinese and Korean sources, which allows him to examine events from several different angles. This contributes to a broad, sweeping narrative, revealing an East Asia made up of many shifting and interrelated parts-not just nation states pursuing their own interests. Akamine's facility with Chinese texts in particular uncovers telling details that add considerably to the historical record. His meticulous account of one of Ryukyu's tribute missions to China, for example, or the role of feng shui in the design of Shuri Castle, the royal and administrative center of the kingdom, is detailed without being pedantic. As a result, readers will come away with a broader, more informed understanding of Ryukyu's significance in the region and the complexity of its relations with its neighbors","subjects":["History — Ryukyu Islands"],"publisherName":"University of Hawaii Press,","publishedDate":"","resourceId":"cab87fd9-27c6-48e9-b53f-2e22354af176"},{"title":"Painting the floating world","subtitle":"ukiyo-e masterpieces from the Weston collection","authors":[{"authorName":"Katz, Janice","roleTerm":"editor"},{"authorName":"Hatayama, Mami","roleTerm":"editor"},{"authorName":"Clark, Timothy","roleTerm":"writer of supplementary textual content"},{"authorName":"Murata, Takako","roleTerm":"writer of supplementary textual content"},{"authorName":"Nagata, Helen","roleTerm":"writer of supplementary textual content"},{"authorName":"Nagata, Seiji","roleTerm":"writer of supplementary textual content"},{"authorName":"Preston, Jennifer","roleTerm":"writer of supplementary textual content"},{"authorName":"Sumpter, Sara","roleTerm":"writer of supplementary textual content"},{"authorName":"Uyeda, Tanya","roleTerm":"writer of supplementary textual content"},{"authorName":"Art Institute of Chicago","roleTerm":""}],"lcCallNumber":"ND1452.J3 P35 2018","ddCallNumber":"754","isbn":"9780300236910","abstract":"\"From the 17th through the 19th century, artists in Kyoto and Edo (now Tokyo) captured the metropolitan amusements of the floating world (ukiyo in Japanese) through depictions of subjects such as the beautiful women of the Yoshiwara pleasure quarters and performers of the kabuki theater.

Challenging the dominant view that women were victimized by the Japanese family laws and its patriarchal biases, Sungyun Lim argues that Korean women had to struggle equally against Korean patriarchal interests. Moreover, women were not passive victims; instead, they proactively struggled to expand their rights by participating in the Japanese colonial legal system. In turn, the Japanese doctrine of promoting progressive legal rights would prove advantageous to them.

In The Fascist Effect, Reto Hofmann uncovers the ideological links that tied Japan to Italy, drawing on extensive materials from Japanese and Italian archives to shed light on the formation of fascist history and practice in Japan and beyond. Moving between personal experiences, diplomatic and cultural relations, and geopolitical considerations, Hofmann shows that interwar Japan found in fascism a resource to develop a new order at a time of capitalist crisis. Japanese thinkers and politicians debated fascism as part of a wider effort to overcome a range of modern woes, including class conflict and moral degeneration, through measures that fostered national cohesion and social order. Hofmann demonstrates that fascism in Japan was neither a European import nor a domestic product; it was, rather, the result of a complex process of global transmission and reformulation. By focusing on how interwar Japanese understood fascism, Hofmann recuperates a historical debate that has been largely disregarded by historians, even though its extent reveals that fascism occupied a central position in the politics of interwar Japan. Far from being a vague term, as postwar historiography has so often claimed, for Japanese of all backgrounds who came of age from the 1920's to the 1940's, fascism conjured up a set of concrete associations, including nationalism, leadership, economics, and a drive toward empire and a new world order","subjects":["Fascism — History — Japan","Fascism — History — Italy","Relations —"],"publisherName":"Cornell University Press","publishedDate":"2015","resourceId":"b610b7e8-b5c5-4d0e-a1b3-ca03c333c30c"},{"title":"Grassroots Fascism","subtitle":"The War Experience of the Japanese People","authors":[{"authorName":"Yoshimi, Yoshiaki","roleTerm":""},{"authorName":"Mark, Ethan","roleTerm":""}],"lcCallNumber":"D811.A2 Y5913 2015","ddCallNumber":"940.53/52","isbn":"9780231538596","abstract":"Grassroots Fascism profiles the Asia Pacific War (1937-1945)-the most important though least understood experience of Japan's modern history-through the lens of ordinary Japanese life.

He enthusiastically assembled a collection of the prints with the idea of dealing in them, and soon was captivated by their colorful and cheerful imagery and style, which began to exert a dramatic influence on his own work. Gradually this enchanted world became his main artistic reference point. From then on, he positioned himself as an artist in the Japanese tradition in order to gain a reputation with the avant-garde of the day. This gorgeous publication offers a detailed reassessment of the impact Japanese printmaking had on Van Gogh's creative output. Featuring essays by the world's leading Van Gogh experts, this book details the ways in which the artist constructed his understanding of a Japanese aesthetic and his utopian ideal of a so-called primitive society, and incorporated these into his own vision and practice. The size, nature, and importance of Van Gogh's own collection of Japanese prints are also explored.

Along the way, he traces the shift in tea's status from exotic gift item from China to its complete nativization in Edo (1603-1868) art and literature and its eventual place on the table of every Japanese household. Farris maintains that tea farming exemplifies the increasing sophistication of Japanese agriculture after 1350, resulting in significant exports of Japanese tea to Euro-American markets, and securing Japan a place among the world's industrialized nations.

This book explores the meanings and practices of \"family\" in Japan, and brings together research by scholars of literature, gender studies, media and cultural studies, sociology and anthropology. While the primary focus is the \"Japanese\" family, it also examines the experience and practice of family beyond the borders of Japan, in such settings as Brazil, Australia, and Bali. The chapters explore key issues such as ageing, single households, non-heterosexual living arrangements and parenting. Moreover, many of the issues addressed, such as the growing diversity of family, the increase in single-person households, and the implications of an ageing society, are applicable to other mature, late-industrial societies. Employing both multi- and inter-disciplinary approaches, this book combines textual analysis of contemporary television, film, literature, manga, anime and other media with empirical and ethnographic studies of families in Japan and in transnational spaces. As such, it will be of great interest to students and scholars working across a number of fields including Japanese culture and society, sociology of family, gender studies, film and media studies, literature and cultural studies, and gerontology\"--","subjects":["Families — Japan","Family demography — Japan","Households — Japan","Social change — Japan","Families","Family demography","Households","Social change","Social history","Social conditions — Japan — 21st century"],"publisherName":"Routledge","publishedDate":"2015","resourceId":"012f74fd-24a5-4ab4-9d86-a8d399b06fc1"},{"title":"Christianity, social justice, and the Japanese American incarceration during World War II","subtitle":"","authors":[{"authorName":"Blankenship, Anne M","roleTerm":""}],"lcCallNumber":"D769.8.A6 B58 2016","ddCallNumber":"940.53/1773","isbn":"9781469629193","abstract":"While most Japanese Americans maintained their traditional identities as Buddhists, a sizeable minority identified as Christian, and a number of church leaders sought to minister to them in the camps.

These religious activists became acutely aware of the impact of government, as well as church, policies that targeted ordinary Americans of diverse ethnicities. Going through the doors of the camp churches and delving deeply into the religious experiences of the incarcerated and the faithful who aided them, Blankenship argues that the incarceration period introduced new social and legal approaches for Christians of all stripes willing to challenge the constitutionality of government policies on race and civil rights.

In this, the most comprehensive treatment in English to date, a senior scholar of early Japan turns to three sources-historical, archaeological, and mythological-to provide a multifaceted study of Himiko and ancient Japanese society","subjects":["History — Japan — To 645"],"publisherName":"University of Hawaii Press,","publishedDate":"","resourceId":"e61f04d2-e28d-42fc-9b69-d67e02aabffc"},{"title":"New times in modern Japan","subtitle":"","authors":[{"authorName":"Tanaka, Stefan","roleTerm":"creator"}],"lcCallNumber":"DS882 .T336 2004","ddCallNumber":"952.03/1","isbn":"1-282-12957-0","abstract":"New Times in Modern Japan concerns the transformation of time--the reckoning of time--during Japan's Meiji period, specifically from around 1870 to 1900. Time literally changed as the archipelago synchronized with the Western imperialists' reckoning of time. The solar calendar and clock became standard timekeeping devices, and society adapted to the abstractions inherent in modern notions of time. This set off a cascade of changes that completely reconfigured how humans interacted with each other and with their environment--a process whose analysis carries implications for other non-Western societies as well. By examining topics ranging from geology, ghosts, childhood, art history, and architecture to nature as a whole, Stefan Tanaka explores how changing conceptions of time destabilized inherited knowledge and practices and ultimately facilitated the reconfiguration of the archipelago's heterogeneous communities into the liberal-capitalist nation-state, Japan. However, this revolutionary transformation--where, in the words of Lewis Mumford, \"the clock, not the steam engine,\" is the key mechanism of the industrial age--has received little more than a footnote in the history of Japan. This book's innovative focus on time not only shifts attention away from debates about the failure (or success) of \"modernization\" toward how individuals interact with the overlay of abstract concepts upon their lives; it also illuminates the roles of history as discourse and as practice in this reconfiguration of society. In doing so, it will influence discussions about modernity well beyond the borders of Japan","subjects":["History — Japan — Meiji period, 1868-1912"],"publisherName":"Princeton University Press","publishedDate":"c2004","resourceId":"829ab207-ca65-46f9-9eea-bea9ac1b4bea"},{"title":"Japan after Japan","subtitle":"social and cultural life from the recessionary 1990s to the present","authors":[{"authorName":"Yoda, Tomiko","roleTerm":""},{"authorName":"Harootunian, Harry D","roleTerm":""}],"lcCallNumber":"DS891 .J35 2006","ddCallNumber":"952.04/9","isbn":"0-8223-3787-8","abstract":"Scholars of history, anthropology, literature, and film explore the transformations in Japanese politics, culture, and society since Japan s recession of the early 1990s","subjects":["History — Japan — Heisei period, 1989-","Economic conditions — Japan — 1989-"],"publisherName":"Duke University Press","publishedDate":"2006","resourceId":"2097577f-de97-41dd-9daa-f0dd34fbfa72"},{"title":"Revolt in Japan","subtitle":"The Young Officers and the February 26, 1936 Incident","authors":[{"authorName":"Shillony, Ben-Ami","roleTerm":""}],"lcCallNumber":"DS888.5","ddCallNumber":"952.03/3","isbn":"0-691-61904-2","abstract":"\"Revere the Emperor, Destroy the Traitors\"-armed with this slogan, on February 26, 1936.

The Young Officers wanted a \"Showa Restoration\" whereby political and economic power would be restored to the Emperor and people. The privileged classes were to be abolished, wealth redistributed, and the state, rather than big business, was to control the economy. Although the rebellion was suppressed in four days, it dramatized ideological clashes and factional strife within the Imperial Army and the tensions between civil and military authorities.The incident still stirs emotions in Japan and fascinates Japanese writers; Mishima Yukio, the famous novelist who committed suicide by seppuku in 1970, was a great admirer of the Young Officers.

Barnes exposes the wartime origins of occupation policy and broader plans for postwar Japan. She considers the role of presidents, bureaucrats, think tanks, the media, and Congress in policymaking. Members of these elite groups came together in an informal policy network that shaped planning. Rather than relying solely on government reports and records to understand policymaking, Barnes also uses letters, memoirs, diaries, and manuscripts written by policymakers to trace the rise and spread of ideas across the policy network.

The Tale of the Heike and the many other works derived from it set in place the depiction of the Heike as failed upstart aristocrats whose spectacular downfall was due to neglect of their warrior heritage and the villainy of the family head, Taira no Kiyomori. Lovable Losers aims to contextualize and deconstruct representations of the Heike not only to show how such representations were created in specific contexts in response to specific needs, but also to demonstrate that the representations themselves came to create and sustain a particular kind of culture. Drawing on the expertise of scholars in a variety of disciplines, this volume explores the Heike in their own time and their depiction as cultural figures in the centuries that followed. Their portrayal in literature and the arts spans more than eight hundred years and a wide range of genres and media, including nō plays, picture scrolls, early modern comic books, novels, and film. In texts from the sixteenth to twentieth centuries, the Heike serve as catalysts for miracles and vectors for subtle criticisms of the Tokugawa government. Over time Kiyomori became an emblem of postwar democracy and economic progress; today he is a powerful symbol of modern citizens' dissatisfaction with politics.The Heike's ambiguous moral standing allowed them to be reimagined, reconstructed, and repurposed by different authors in different contexts, as both heroes and villains. Rather than assuming their failure, Lovable Losers repositions the Heike within the larger phenomenon of the Genpei War and its aftermath, demonstrating how they took advantage of their station as nobles and warriors. The new research it presents seeks to transcend categorization and blur the lines between different approaches to the Heike to give a well-rounded depiction of a family who has played a defining role in Japanese culture in action, in memory, and somewhere in between","subjects":["In literature","History — Japan — Heian period, 794-1185"],"publisherName":"University of Hawaii Press,","publishedDate":"","resourceId":"63c37f1f-0d07-4c14-83d1-111fe0b7583c"},{"title":"Art and engagement in early postwar Japan","subtitle":"","authors":[{"authorName":"Jesty, Justin","roleTerm":""}],"lcCallNumber":"N72.P6 .J478 2018","ddCallNumber":"701/.03","isbn":"1-5017-1506-2","abstract":"Justin Jesty's Art and Engagement in Early Postwar Japan reframes the history of art and its politics in Japan post-1945. This fascinating cultural history addresses our broad understanding of the immediate postwar era moving toward the Cold War and subsequent consolidations of political and cultural life. At the same time, Jesty delves into an examination of the relationship between art and politics that approaches art as a mode of intervention, but he moves beyond the idea that the artwork or artist unilaterally authors political significance to trace how creations and expressive acts may (or may not) actually engage the terms of shared meaning and value.Art and Engagement in Early Postwar Japan centers on a group of social realists on the radical left who hoped to wed their art with anti-capitalist and anti-war activism, a liberal art education movement whose focus on the child inspired innovation in documentary film, and a regional avant-garde group split between ambition and local loyalty. In each case, Jesty examines writings and artworks, together with the social movements they were a part of, to demonstrate how art-or more broadly, creative expression-became a medium for collectivity and social engagement. He reveals a shared if varied aspiration to create a culture founded in amateur-professional interaction, expanded access to the tools of public authorship, and dispersed and participatory cultural forms that intersected easily with progressive movements. Highlighting the transformational nature of the early postwar, Jesty deftly contrasts it with the relative stasis, consolidation, and homogenization of the 1960s","subjects":["Art — Political aspects — History — Japan — 20th century","Art and social action — History — Japan — 20th century","Art, Japanese — 20th century"],"publisherName":"Cornell University Press","publishedDate":"2018","resourceId":"b577f1b1-7450-4bfb-992a-a6297963f919"},{"title":"Samurai","subtitle":"a concise history","authors":[{"authorName":"Wert, Michael","roleTerm":""}],"lcCallNumber":"DS827.S3 W47 2019","ddCallNumber":"952/.025","isbn":"9780190932947","abstract":"","subjects":["Samurai"],"publisherName":"Oxford University Press","publishedDate":"","resourceId":"0708febb-a718-4b9a-8939-cd41c45cf286"},{"title":"Hidden Atrocities","subtitle":"Japanese Germ Warfare and American Obstruction of Justice at the Tokyo Trial","authors":[{"authorName":"Guillemin, Jeanne","roleTerm":""}],"lcCallNumber":"KZ1181","ddCallNumber":"341.6/90268","isbn":"9780231544986","abstract":"In the aftermath of World War II, the Allied intent to bring Axis crimes to light led to both the Nuremberg trials and their counterpart in Tokyo, the International Military Tribunal of the Far East.

In Hidden Atrocities, Jeanne Guillemin goes behind the scenes at the trial to reveal the American obstruction that denied justice to Japan's victims.Responsibility for Japan's secret germ-warfare program, organized as Unit 731 in Harbin, China, extended to top government leaders and many respected scientists, all of whom escaped indictment. Instead, motivated by early Cold War tensions, U.S. military intelligence in Tokyo insinuated itself into the Tokyo Trial by blocking prosecution access to key witnesses and then classifying incriminating documents. Washington decision makers, supported by the American occupation leader, General Douglas MacArthur, sought to acquire Japan's biological-warfare expertise to gain an advantage over the Soviet Union, suspected of developing both biological and nuclear weapons. Ultimately, U.S. national-security goals left the victims of Unit 731 without vindication. Decades later, evidence of the Unit 731 atrocities still troubles relations between China and Japan.

To interrogate the significance for medieval writers of narrating such pasts as a Mirror, Erin Brightwell traces a series of innovations across these and related texts that emerge in the face of disorder. In so doing, she uncovers how a dynamic web of evolving concepts of time, place, language use, and cosmological forces was deployed to order the past in an age of unprecedented social movement and upheaval. Despite the Mirrors' common concerns and commitments, traditional linguistic and disciplinary boundaries have downplayed or obscured their significance for medieval thinkers.

In Arbiters of Patriotism, John Person explores the lives of two of the most notorious right-wing intellectuals responsible for leading such attacks in prewar and wartime Japan: Minoda Muneki (1894–1946) and Mitsui Kōshi (1883–1953) of the Genri Nippon (Japan Principle) Society.As fervent proponents of Japanism, the ethno-nationalist ideology of Imperial Japan, Minoda and Mitsui appointed themselves judges of correct nationalist expression. They built careers out of publishing polemics condemning Marxist and progressive academics and writers, thereby ruining dozens of livelihoods. Person traces Japanism’s rise to literary and philosophical developments in the late-Meiji (1868–1912) and Taisho (1912–1926) eras, when vitalist theories championed emotion and volition over reason. Founding their ideas of nationalism on the amorphous regions of the human psyche, Japanists labeled liberalism and Marxism as misunderstandings of the national particularities of human experience. For more than a decade, government agents and politicians used Minoda’s and Mitsui’s publications to remove their political enemies and advance their own agendas. But in time they came to regard both men and other nationalist intellectuals as potential thought criminals. Whether collaborating with the government to crush the voices of class struggle or becoming the targets of police surveillance themselves, Minoda and Mitsui came to embody the paradoxically hegemonic yet arbitrary nature of nationalist ideology in Imperial Japan.

Charged with \"protecting and controlling\" local Japanese communities first in Korea and later in China, these consular police played a critical role in facilitating Japanese imperial expansion during the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Remarkably, however, this police force remains largely unknown. Crossing Empire's Edge is the first book in English to reveal its complex history. Based on extensive analysis of both archival and recently published Japanese sources, Erik Esselstrom describes how the Gaimusho police became deeply involved in the surveillance and suppression of the Korean independence movement in exile throughout Chinese treaty ports and the Manchurian frontier during the 1920s and 1930s. It had in fact evolved over the years from a relatively benign public security organization into a full-fledged political intelligence apparatus devoted to apprehending purveyors of \"dangerous thought\" throughout the empire. Furthermore, the history of consular police operations indicates that ideological crime was a borderless security problem; Gaimusho police worked closely with colonial and metropolitan Japanese police forces to target Chinese, Korean, and Japanese suspects alike from Shanghai to Seoul to Tokyo. Esselstrom thus offers a nuanced interpretation of Japanese expansionism by highlighting the transnational links between consular, colonial, and metropolitan policing of subversive political movements during the prewar and wartime eras. In addition, by illuminating the fervor with which consular police often pressed for unilateral solutions to Japan's political security crises on the continent, he challenges orthodox understandings of the relationship between civil and military institutions within the imperial Japanese state. While historians often still depict the Gaimusho as an inhibitor of unilateral military expansionism during the first half of the twentieth century, Esselstrom's exposé on the activities and ideology of the consular police dramatically challenges this narrative. Revealing a far greater complexity of motivation behind the Japanese colonial mission, Crossing Empire's Edge boldly illustrates how the imperial Japanese state viewed political security at home as inextricably connected to political security abroad from as early as 1919-nearly a decade before overt military aggression began-and approaches northeast Asia as a region of intricate and dynamic social, economic, and political forces. In doing so, Crossing Empire's Edge inspires new ways of thinking about both modern Japanese history and the modern history of Japan in East Asia","subjects":["History"],"publisherName":"University of Hawai'i Press","publishedDate":"2020","resourceId":"33caf4b4-85ff-4c8e-ab49-011ae9c29a6b"},{"title":"Japan at the Crossroads","subtitle":"Conflict and Compromise after Anpo","authors":[{"authorName":"Kapur, Nick","roleTerm":""}],"lcCallNumber":"HN723.5 K355 2018eb","ddCallNumber":"322.4/40952","isbn":"9780674988507","abstract":"In 1960, when Japan revised the postwar treaty that allows a U.S. military presence in Japan, the popular backlash changed the evolution of Japan’s politics and culture, and its global role.

This case study of the reading and writing of one diasporic population challenges the dominant mode of literary study, in which texts are often explicitly or implicitly understood through a framework of ethno-nationalism. Self-representations by writers in the diaspora reveal flaws in this prevailing framework through what Edward Mack calls \"acquired alterity,\" in which expectations about the stability of ethnic identity are subverted in surprising ways.

It draws on recent developments in the theoretical and empirical literature and on the experience of 5 industrialized countries Germany, the UK, France, the USA and Japan. Over the past half century the mainstream view of industrial policy has varied markedly. From the early 1950s to the early 1970s industrial policy was seen as panacea to growth and development problems. Pursuing industrial policy became almost taboo in the early 1980s. Current views are breaking away from past trends, with the development and testing of new economic theories, attitudes towards industrial policy are now less clear-cut. In light of the current financial crisis, this volume presents economic theory and critical views on the implementation of public support policies, and offers a structured, up-to-date analysis relating theory, practices and effectiveness of industrial policy.

It was the largest disaster to affect postwar Japan and one of the most destructive postwar natural disasters to strike a developed country. Although the media focused on the disaster's immediate effects, the long-term reconstruction efforts have gone largely unexplored. Drawing on fieldwork and interviews with planners, activists, and bureaucrats, David Edgington records the first ten years of reconstruction and recovery efforts and offers detailed descriptions of the geography of crisis and opportunity. Which districts were most vulnerable to quake and why? Did policy makers and planners exploit opportunities to revitalize the city and make it more sustainable and disaster proof? Edgington's intricate investigation of Japanese urban policy, local governance, and land use in stricken neighbourhoods reveals that Japan's particular style of urban redevelopment hindered rather than hastened its ability to rebuild a devastated city. An absorbing account of the largest urban-planning redevelopment effort in Japanese history and the disaster that caused it, Reconstructing Kobe offers real-world solutions to urban planners and policy makers and is essential reading for students and scholars of Japanese urban and planning history","subjects":["City planning —","Urban renewal —","Kobe Earthquake, Japan, 1995","Urban renewal — History —","Land use —","Municipal government —","Social conditions — Kōbe-shi (Japan)","Economic conditions — Kōbe-shi (Japan)"],"publisherName":"UBC Press","publishedDate":"c2010","resourceId":"93a513c6-f5d4-48c9-af3e-7901a8b577c8"},{"title":"Assessing the Guam war claims process","subtitle":"Committee on Armed Services, House of Representatives, One Hundred Eleventh Congress, first session, hearing held December 2, 2009","authors":[{"authorName":"United States","roleTerm":"creator"}],"lcCallNumber":"KF27 .A7 2009za","ddCallNumber":"","isbn":"","abstract":"","subjects":["Evaluation","World War, 1939-1945 — Claims","World War, 1939-1945 — Reparations","World War, 1939-1945 — Atrocities — Guam","World War, 1939-1945 — Destruction and pillage — Guam","Chamorro (Micronesian people) — Claims — Guam","Chamorro (Micronesian people) — Reparations — Guam","Military bases — Guam","Claims vs. Japan — Guam","History — Guam — Japanese occupation, 1941-1944"],"publisherName":"U.S. G.P.O","publishedDate":"2010","resourceId":"4ad0b970-41dd-438e-94a8-bfcabb026b0c"},{"title":"The Technological Imaginary of Imperial Japan, 1931-1945","subtitle":"","authors":[{"authorName":"Moore, Aaron Stephen","roleTerm":"creator"}],"lcCallNumber":"","ddCallNumber":"","isbn":"","abstract":"","subjects":[],"publisherName":"","publishedDate":"","resourceId":"e682450f-d693-4613-926c-a557daff3889"},{"title":"Outlook for economic activity and prices","subtitle":"","authors":[{"authorName":"Nihon Ginkō","roleTerm":""}],"lcCallNumber":"HC462.95 .O98","ddCallNumber":"","isbn":"","abstract":"","subjects":["Economic forecasting — Periodicals — Japan","Economic indicators — Periodicals — Japan","Prices — Periodicals — Japan","Fiscal policy — Periodicals — Japan","Economic forecasting","Economic history","Economic indicators","Economic policy","Fiscal policy","Prices","Economic conditions — — Japan — 1989-","Economic policy — — Japan — 1989-"],"publisherName":"Bank of Japan","publishedDate":"2004-","resourceId":"918e2526-cc3d-4ae5-8769-3c6fa02f52cb"},{"title":"Hiroshima, Japan","subtitle":"","authors":[{"authorName":"Bartlett, G.

It provides identity whilst at the same time imposing identity upon everyone registered, and in turn, the state receives validity and legitimacy from the registration of its inhabitants. The study of the procedures and mechanisms for identifying and documenting people provides an important window into understanding statecraft, and by examining the koseki system, this book provides a keen insight into social and political change in Japan.By looking through the lens of the koseki system, the book takes both an historical as well as a contemporary approach to understanding Japanese society. In doing so, it develops our understanding of contemporary Japan within the historical context of population management and social control; reveals the social effects and influence of the koseki system throughout its history; and presents new insights into citizenship, nationality and identity. Furthermore, this book develops our knowledge of state functions and indeed the nation state itself, through engaging critically with important issues relating to the koseki while at the same time providing a platform for further investigation. The contributors to this volume utilise a variety of disciplinary areas including history, gender studies, sociology, law and anthropology, and each chapter provides insights that bring us closer to a comprehensive grasp of the role, effects and historical background of what is a crucial and influential instrument of the Japanese state.This book will be of great interest to students and scholars of Japanese history, Japanese culture and society, Japanese studies, Asian social policy and demography more generally. \"--","subjects":["Recording and registration — Japan","Recording and registration — Social aspects — Japan","Citizenship — Japan","Registers of births, etc — Japan","Registers — Japan"],"publisherName":"Routledge","publishedDate":"2014","resourceId":"26fae4a0-6494-4304-86b1-92f029595c98"},{"title":"After Fukushima","subtitle":"the equivalence of catastrophes","authors":[{"authorName":"Nancy, Jean-Luc","roleTerm":"creator"}],"lcCallNumber":"B2430.N363 E6413 2015","ddCallNumber":"363.3401","isbn":"9780823263387 (hbk.)","abstract":"\"In this book, the philosopher Jean-Luc Nancy examines the nature of catastrophes in the era of globalization and technology.

Heritage conservation has been intimately linked to Japan's sense of national identity, in addition to its self-portrayal as a responsible global and regional citizen. This book explores the concepts of heritage, nationalism and Japanese national identity in the context of Japanese and international history since the second half of the nineteenth century. In doing so, it shows how Japan has built on its distinctive approach to conservation to develop a heritage-based strategy which has been used as part of its cultural diplomacy designed to increase its 'soft power' both globally and within the Asian region. More broadly, Natsuko Akagawa underlines the theoretical nexus between the politics of heritage conservation, cultural diplomacy and national interest, and in turn highlights how issues of heritage conservation practice and policy are crucial to a comprehensive understanding of geo-politics.

Memories and dreams in turn conjure their magical counterparts--people without names or pasts, fantastic animals, half-animals, and talking machines that traverse the dark psychic underworld of this writer's extraordinary fiction. Fervently acclaimed worldwide, Murakami's wildly imaginative work in many ways remains a mystery, its worlds within worlds uncharted territory. Finally in this book readers will find a map to the strange realm that grounds virtually every aspect of Murakami's writing. A journey through the enigmatic and baffling innermost mind, a metaphysical dimension where Murakami's most bizarre scenes and characters lurk, The Forbidden Worlds of Haruki Murakami exposes the psychological and mythological underpinnings of this other world. Matthew Carl Strecher shows how these considerations color Murakami's depictions of the individual and collective soul, which constantly shift between the tangible and intangible but in this literary landscape are undeniably real. Through these otherworldly depths The Forbidden Worlds of Haruki Murakami also charts the writer's vivid \"inner world,\" whether unconscious or underworld (what some Japanese critics call achiragawa, or \"over there\"), and its connectivity to language. Strecher covers all of Murakami's work--including his efforts as a literary journalist--and concludes with the first full-length close reading of the writer's newest novel, Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki and His Years of Pilgrimage. \"--","subjects":["Criticism and interpretation"],"publisherName":"University of Minnesota Press","publishedDate":"","resourceId":"1bf089e2-5480-411b-8aec-543fe089dada"},{"title":"Neonationalist mythology in postwar Japan","subtitle":"Pal's dissenting judgment at the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal","authors":[{"authorName":"Nakazato, Nariaki","roleTerm":""}],"lcCallNumber":"KZ1181 .N35 2016","ddCallNumber":"341.6/90268","isbn":"9781498528351","abstract":"","subjects":["Influence","Tokyo Trial, Tokyo, Japan, 1946-1948","Nationalism — History — Japan — 20th century","Judges — Biography — India"],"publisherName":"Lexington Books","publishedDate":"","resourceId":"d1e76581-b4ee-46cd-a22e-785ced68f006"},{"title":"Japanese moratorium on the death penalty","subtitle":"","authors":[{"authorName":"Obara-Minnitt, Mika","roleTerm":""}],"lcCallNumber":"HV8699.J3 O23 2016","ddCallNumber":"","isbn":"9781137565303","abstract":"Offering a timely reanalysis of the issue of Japan’s capital punishment policy, this cutting edge volume considers the de facto moratorium periods in Japan’s death penalty system and proposes an alternative analytical framework to examine the policy.

Edo Culture presents a selection of Nishiyama's writings that serves not only to provide an excellent introduction to Tokugawa cultural history but also to fill many gaps in our knowledge of the daily life and diversions of the urban populace of the time. Many essays focus on the most important theme of Nishiyama's work: the seventeenth to nineteenth centuries as a time of appropriation and development of Japan's culture by its urban commoners. In the first of three main sections, Nishiyama outlines the history of Edo (Tokyo) during the city's formative years, showing how it was shaped by the constant interaction between its warrior and commoner classes. Next, he discusses the spirit and aesthetic of the Edo native and traces the woodblock prints known as ukiyo-e to the communal activities of the city's commoners. Section two focuses on the interaction of urban and rural culture during the nineteenth century and on the unprecedented cultural diffusion that occurred with the help of itinerant performers, pilgrims, and touring actors. Among the essays is a delightful and detailed discourse on Tokugawa cuisine. The third section is dedicated to music and theatre, beginning with a study of no, which was patronized mainly by the aristocracy but surprisingly by commoners as well. In separate chapters, Nishiyama analyzes the relation of social classes to musical genres and the aesthetics of kabuki. The final chapter focuses on vaudeville houses supported by the urban masses","subjects":["Civilization — Japan — 1600-1868"],"publisherName":"University of Hawaii Press","publishedDate":"","resourceId":"1b79a32c-24a9-4c96-9e43-06c7149c34fc"},{"title":"The Gates of Power","subtitle":"Monks, Courtiers, and Warriors in Premodern Japan","authors":[{"authorName":"Adolphson, Mikael S","roleTerm":""}],"lcCallNumber":"DS850 .A36 2000eb","ddCallNumber":"952","isbn":"0-8248-6474-3","abstract":"The political influence of temples in premodern Japan, most clearly manifested in divine demonstrations-where rowdy monks and shrine servants brought holy symbols to the capital to exert pressure on courtiers-has traditionally been condemned and is poorly understood. In an impressive examination of this intriguing aspect of medieval Japan, the author employs a wide range of previously neglected sources to argue that religious protest was a symptom of political factionalism in the capital rather than its cause. It is his contention that religious violence can be traced primarily to attempts by secular leaders to rearrange religious and political hierarchies to their own advantage, thereby leaving disfavored religious institutions to fend for their accustomed rights and status. In this context, divine demonstrations became the preferred negotiating tool for monastic complexes. For almost three centuries, such strategies allowed a handful of elite temples to maintain enough of an equilibrium to sustain and defend the old style of rulership even against the efforts of the Ashikaga Shogunate in the mid-fourteenth century. By acknowledging temples and monks as legitimate co-rulers, The Gates of Power provides a new synthesis of Japanese rulership from the late Heian (794-1185) to the early Muromachi (1336-1573) eras, offering a unique and comprehensive analysis that brings together the spheres of art, religion, ideas, and politics in medieval Japan","subjects":["Politics and government — Japan — 794-1600"],"publisherName":"University of Hawaii Press,","publishedDate":"","resourceId":"d86b9cae-bc44-4a2d-a6e1-21e7ac5c6e12"},{"title":"三田学会雑誌 [[ミタガッカイザッシ]]","subtitle":"","authors":[{"authorName":"Keiō Gijuku Keizai Gakkai","roleTerm":""}],"lcCallNumber":"HB9 .M56","ddCallNumber":"","isbn":"","abstract":"","subjects":["Economics","Economic history","Economic conditions — Japan"],"publisherName":"","publishedDate":"","resourceId":"8225b256-8d65-4b65-a43e-205cb449c8ff"},{"title":"The ghosts of Iwo Jima","subtitle":"","authors":[{"authorName":"Burrell, Robert S","roleTerm":"creator"}],"lcCallNumber":"D767.99.I9 B87 2006","ddCallNumber":"940.54/2528","isbn":"1-60344-549-8","abstract":"","subjects":["History — World War, 1939-1945","Iwo Jima, Battle of, Japan, 1945","Marines — United States"],"publisherName":"Texas A&M University Press","publishedDate":"c2006","resourceId":"f8c3813e-e2d4-4758-bddd-a240fcbdebbd"},{"title":"Japan to 1600","subtitle":"A Social and Economic History","authors":[{"authorName":"Farris, William Wayne","roleTerm":""}],"lcCallNumber":"HN723 -- F377 2009eb","ddCallNumber":"952.01","isbn":"0-8248-7011-5","abstract":"Japan to 1600 surveys Japanese historical development from the first evidence of human habitation in the archipelago to the consolidation of political power under the Tokugawa shogunate at the beginning of the seventeenth century.

In accessible language punctuated with lively and interesting examples, William Wayne Farris weaves together major economic and social themes. The book focuses on continuity and change in social and economic structures and experiences, but it by no means ignores the political and cultural. Most chapters begin with an outline of political developments, and cultural phenomena-particularly religious beliefs-are also taken into account. In addition, Japan to 1600 addresses the growing connectedness between residents of the archipelago and the rest of the world.Farris describes how the early inhabitants of the islands moved from a forager mode of subsistence to a more predominantly agrarian base, supplemented by sophisticated industries and an advanced commercial economy. He reveals how the transition to farming took place over many centuries as people moved back and forth from settled agriculture to older forager-collector regimes in response to ecological, political, and personal factors. Economics influenced demographics, and, as the population expanded, the class structure became increasingly complex and occupational specialization and status divisions more intricate. Along with this came trends toward more tightly knit corporate organizations (village, city, market, family), and classes of servants, slaves, and outcastes formed. In reflecting the diversity of traditional Japan's economy and society, Japan to 1600 is well suited for both undergraduate and graduate courses and will be a welcome introduction to Japan's early history for scholars and students of other disciplines and regions","subjects":["Economic conditions — Japan — To 1868","Social conditions — Japan — To 1600"],"publisherName":"University of Hawaii Press,","publishedDate":"","resourceId":"353a323b-4c92-4343-b244-1fdd810c843b"},{"title":"The limits of Okinawa","subtitle":"Japanese capitalism, living labor, and theorizations of community","authors":[{"authorName":"Matsumura, Wendy","roleTerm":"creator"}],"lcCallNumber":"HC463.O4 M387 2015","ddCallNumber":"330.952/2903","isbn":"0-8223-5801-8","abstract":"Since its incorporation into the Japanese nation-state in 1879, Okinawa has been seen by both Okinawans and Japanese as an exotic \"South,\" both spatially and temporally distinct from modern Japan.

The book provides a broad and nuanced picture of the varied literary responses to this ongoing tragedy, focusing on \"serious fiction\" (junbungaku), the one area of Japanese cultural production that has consistently addressed the disaster and its aftermath. Examining short stories and novels by both new and established writers, author Rachel DiNitto effectively captures this literary tide and names it after the nuclear accident that turned a natural disaster into an environmental and political catastrophe.The book takes a spatial approach to a new literary landscape, tracing Fukushima fiction thematically from depictions of the local experience of victims on the ground, through the regional and national conceptualizations of the disaster, to considerations of the disaster as history, and last to the global concerns common to nuclear incidents worldwide. Throughout, DiNitto shows how fiction writers played an important role in turning the disaster into a narrative of trauma that speaks to a broad readership within and outside Japan. Although the book examines fiction about all three of the disasters-earthquake, tsunami, and nuclear meltdowns-DiNitto contends that Fukushima fiction reaches its critical potential as a literature of nuclear resistance. She articulates the stakes involved, arguing that serious fiction provides the critical voice necessary to combat the government and nuclear industry's attempts to move the disaster off the headlines as the 2020 Olympics approach and Japan restarts its idle nuclear power plants.Rigorous and sophisticated yet highly readable and relevant for a broad audience, Fukushima Fiction is a critical intervention of humanities scholarship into the growing field of Fukushima studies. The work pushes readers to understand the disaster as a global crisis and to see the importance of literature as a critical medium in a media-saturated world. By engaging with other disasters-from 9/11 to Chernobyl to Hurricane Katrina-DiNitto brings Japan's local and national tragedy to the attention of a global audience, evocatively conveying fiction's power to imagine the unimaginable and the unforeseen","subjects":["Fukushima Nuclear Disaster, Japan, 2011, in literature","Japanese literature — History and criticism — 21st century"],"publisherName":"University of Hawaii Press,","publishedDate":"","resourceId":"faf57cec-94f1-48b1-9787-d90895db3718"},{"title":"Historia de Japón","subtitle":"","authors":[{"authorName":"Walker, Brett L","roleTerm":"creator"},{"authorName":"Bevia, Herminia","roleTerm":"traductor"}],"lcCallNumber":"DS835 W1776 2017","ddCallNumber":"952","isbn":"84-460-4352-1","abstract":"","subjects":["Japan — History"],"publisherName":"Akal","publishedDate":"2017","resourceId":"03a5552b-8ce5-4c19-a0ee-f9930160b410"},{"title":"The Merchant's Tale","subtitle":"Yokohama and the Transformation of Japan","authors":[{"authorName":"Partner, Simon","roleTerm":""}],"lcCallNumber":"HN730.Y65 P37 2018","ddCallNumber":"306.0952/1364","isbn":"9780231544467","abstract":"In April 1859, at age fifty, Shinohara Chūemon left his old life behind. Chūemon, a well-off farmer in his home village, departed for the new port city of Yokohama, where he remained for the next fourteen years. There, as a merchant trading with foreigners in the aftermath of Japan's 1853 \"opening\" to the West, he witnessed the collapse of the Tokugawa shogunate, the civil war that followed, and the Meiji Restoration's reforms. The Merchant's Tale looks through Chūemon's eyes at the upheavals of this period.In a narrative history rich in colorful detail, Simon Partner uses the story of an ordinary merchant farmer and its Yokohama setting as a vantage point onto sweeping social transformation and its unwitting agents. Chūemon, like most newcomers to Yokohama, came in search of economic opportunity. His story sheds light on vital issues in Japan's modern history, including the legacies of the Meiji Restoration; the East Asian treaty port system; and the importance of everyday life-food, clothing, medicine, and hygiene-for national identity. Centered on an individual, The Merchant's Tale is also the story of a place. Created under pressure from aggressive foreign powers, Yokohama was the scene of gunboat diplomacy, a connection to global markets, the birthplace of new lifestyles, and the beachhead of Japan's modernization.

By the middle of the twentieth century, art education was a permanent part of Japanese and Egyptian primary schooling. Both countries taught music and drawing, and wartime Japan also taught calligraphy. Why did art education become a core feature of schooling in societies as distant as Japan and Egypt, and how is aesthetics entangled with nationalism, colonialism, and empire?Beauty in the Age of Empire is a global history of aesthetic education focused on how Western practices were adopted, transformed, and repurposed in Egypt and Japan. Raja Adal uncovers the emergence of aesthetic education in modern schools and its role in making a broad spectrum of ideologies from fascism to humanism attractive. With aesthetics, educators sought to enchant children with sounds and sights, using their ears and eyes to make ideologies into objects of desire. Spanning multiple languages and continents, and engaging with the histories of nationalism, art, education, and transnational exchanges, Beauty in the Age of Empire offers a strikingly original account of the rise of aesthetics in modern schools and the modern world. It shows that while aesthetics is important to all societies, it was all the more important for those on the receiving end of Western expansion, which could not claim to be wealthier or more powerful than Western empires, only more beautiful","subjects":["Arts in education","Arts — Study and teaching (Primary) — Egypt","Arts — Study and teaching (Primary) — Japan"],"publisherName":"Columbia University Press,","publishedDate":"","resourceId":"2db1c97a-e02c-402d-baa9-1e719dd2a6e5"},{"title":"Law and society in imperial Japan","subtitle":"Suehiro Izutarō and the search for equity","authors":[{"authorName":"Morgan, Jason Michael","roleTerm":""}],"lcCallNumber":"KNX110.S85 M67 2020","ddCallNumber":"340.092 B","isbn":"9781604979930","abstract":"\"This is the first monograph on Suehiro in the English language.

Less understood, however, is the nature of Japan-China relations during the intervening decades. How did a popular Japanese perception of China that facilitated imperial aggression during the early 1940s become one that embraced both the restoration of friendly diplomatic ties and the cultivation of mutually beneficial economic and cultural interactions by the early 1970s? Exploring everyday Japanese impressions of the People's Republic of China from the end of the U.S. Occupation in 1952 to the normalization of Japan-China relations in 1972, this book analyzes representations of the PRC in Japanese print media and visual culture in connection with four main topics: the 1954 visit to Japan by PRC Minister of Health Li Dequan, China's atomic weapons testing in 1964-1967, the Red Guard movement of the early Cultural Revolution years, and the culture of continental \"rediscovery\" in 1971-1972. Japanese views of the Chinese world under Chairman Mao were infused with elements of thematic and conceptual continuity linking the prewar, wartime, and postwar eras. In sketching out a portrait of these elements, as revealed in a wide variety of popular media sources of that time, author Erik Esselstrom explains how the reconstruction of Japan's relationship with China after the Second World War included far more than just the trials and tribulations of Cold War diplomacy. In so doing, the book reintegrates the history of postwar Japan-China relations within a much longer history of East Asian cultural interaction and engagement.Firmly grounded in rigorous primary source analysis, but also crafted with a highly accessible style and structure, That Distant Country Next Door offers new insights to scholars of modern East Asian history and provides a compelling and provocative story for readers seeking a more sophisticated understanding of modern Japanese society and the history of modern Japan-China relations","subjects":["HISTORY / Asia / Japan"],"publisherName":"University of Hawaii Press,","publishedDate":"","resourceId":"8e1f5127-816c-42e0-8043-00f068eb4bbe"},{"title":"The vow from Hiroshima","subtitle":"","authors":[{"authorName":"Strickler, Susan C","roleTerm":""},{"authorName":"Takeuchi, Mitchie","roleTerm":""},{"authorName":"Silverman, Renée","roleTerm":"screenwriter"},{"authorName":"Not Just a Survivor Film","roleTerm":"production company"},{"authorName":"Bullfrog Films","roleTerm":"distributor"}],"lcCallNumber":"D767.25.H6 V69 2020","ddCallNumber":"940.5425","isbn":"","abstract":"The Vow from Hiroshima is a portrait of Setsuko Thurlow, a passionate, 85-year-old survivor of the atomic bomb in Hiroshima.

Watanabe covers in great detail several topics pertaining to this civilization, including the status and position of the various social classes, views of women and children, attitudes towards sex, labor, and the body and religious beliefs, as well as the unique cosmology behind this civilization. Watanabe makes use of a number of works written by foreign observers who visited Japan from the end of the Edo period to the beginning of the Meiji to support his views.

Schaller argues that the reconstruction of postwar Japan not only shaped the future of that country but the future of U.S. policy throughout postwar Asia, leading up to the controversial interventions in China, Korea, and Vietnam. The author shows how after the war, the United States sought to develop Japan as a stable bulwark against both Soviet expansion and Asian revolution. Schaller depicts the intense contest that raged among Americans, pitting the flamboyant Occupation Commander, General Douglas MacArthur, against virtually all civilian and military planners in Washington, including the president. First hailed as a hero and given nearly free reign to shape Japan's future, MacArthur was ultimately denounced by Truman and his advisors as a \"bunko artist\" who had wrecked Japan's economy and opened it to Communist influence. In place of MacArthur's ambitious social and economic reforms, the new Occupation program reconcentrated power in the hands of Japans's old elite. The book shows how Communist control of China and North Korea cut Japan off from its historic trading partners and forced officials to focus on developing the rich but unstable Southeast Asian states. Washington feared that economic blackmail alone would pull Japan into the Soviet orbit. Determined to secure Japan--the ultimate \"domino\"--The United States spurned possible detente with China, extended military aid to the French in Indochina, and finally entered the Korean War.--Publisher description","subjects":["Foreign relations —","History — Japan — Allied occupation, 1945-1952","Foreign relations — United States — 1945-1953","Foreign relations — Japan — 1945-"],"publisherName":"Oxford University Press","publishedDate":"1985","resourceId":"fa055563-daa9-471a-abf1-474d35b8b34f"},{"title":"Sėn Katai︠a︡ma","subtitle":"nauchnai︠a︡ biografii︠a︡","authors":[{"authorName":"Senatorov, A.

This book provides the first full account in English of the banking industry in Japan for the century following the opening of the country to the outside world in 1859. Professor Tamaki begins by considering the period of experimentation during the Meiji Restoration which resulted in the adoption of the Gold Standard in 1891. He then offers a detailed examination of the highly profitable years up to the end of the First World War and of the subsequent crisis which was hastened by the earthquake that devastated Tokyo and Yokohama in 1923 and sealed by the financial collapse of 1927. New light is thrown on the extraordinary role played by the banking industry during the period of military expansionism which culminated with defeat in the Second World War. The book ends with an assessment of the post-war financial system which developed out of the Macarthur directives and the subsequent American 'democratisation' programme.\"--BOOK JACKET","subjects":["Banks and banking — History — Japan"],"publisherName":"Cambridge University Press","publishedDate":"1995","resourceId":"403ff0ef-d4b9-4908-8b3e-85539e146bbd"},{"title":"Monthly report of recent economic and financial developments","subtitle":"","authors":[{"authorName":"Nihon Ginkō","roleTerm":""}],"lcCallNumber":"HC461 .N46","ddCallNumber":"330.95205 M65","isbn":"","abstract":"","subjects":["Securities — — Japan","Economic history","Economic policy","Securities","Economic conditions — — Japan — 1989-","Economic policy — — Japan — 1989-"],"publisherName":"The Bank","publishedDate":"1998-2015","resourceId":"164f91d4-7908-4d6c-960b-9872b5ab0760"},{"title":"Even the gods rebel","subtitle":"the peasants of Takaino and the 1871 Nakano Uprising in Japan","authors":[{"authorName":"Esenbel, Selçuk","roleTerm":"creator"}],"lcCallNumber":"DS897.T2976 E36 1998","ddCallNumber":"952/.163","isbn":"0924304383","abstract":"","subjects":["Nakano Peasant Uprising, Japan, 1871","History — Takaino-mura (Nagano-ken, Japan)"],"publisherName":"Association for Asian Studies","publishedDate":"c1998","resourceId":"0f7abf0d-12df-41c3-9a6d-7a97b7737045"},{"title":"Flags of our fathers","subtitle":"","authors":[{"authorName":"Bradley, James","roleTerm":""},{"authorName":"Powers, Ron","roleTerm":"author"},{"authorName":"Vidal, Gore","roleTerm":"former owner"}],"lcCallNumber":"D767.99.I9 B73 2000","ddCallNumber":"940.54/26","isbn":"0553111337","abstract":"","subjects":["Iwo Jima, Battle of, Japan, 1945 — Pictorial works","Photographs — History — 20th century","World War, 1939-1945 — Photography","Marines — Biography — United States"],"publisherName":"Bantam Books","publishedDate":"2000","resourceId":"94c5b02f-4d4b-4547-8f54-83e85c4c6a00"},{"title":"Taehan Cheguk ki Ilbon'gun ŭi ch'imnyak kwa minjok ŭi chŏhang","subtitle":"","authors":[{"authorName":"Kwŏn, Ku-hun","roleTerm":"creator"}],"lcCallNumber":"DS915.37 .K93 2000","ddCallNumber":"","isbn":"","abstract":"","subjects":["Militarism — Japan","Korean resistance movements, 1905-1945","Annexation to Japan — History — Korea","Military policy — Japan","Foreign relations — Korea — 1864-1910","Foreign relations — Japan — 1868-1912"],"publisherName":"","publishedDate":"","resourceId":"661641a6-b572-4472-ab5a-bcec46f82a9c"},{"title":"Pacific victory","subtitle":"Tarawa to Okinawa 1943-1945","authors":[{"authorName":"Wright, Derrick","roleTerm":"creator"}],"lcCallNumber":"D767 .W75 2005","ddCallNumber":"940.5426","isbn":"0750937467 (hbk.)","abstract":"The American 'island-hopping' campaign in the Pacific during the Second World War was a crucial factor in the eventual defeat of Japan in 1945 ...

In 1979, the book Japan as Number One: Lessons for America by Harvard University professor Ezra Vogel caused a sensation in the United States by pointing out that Japan was surpassing America as world economic leader; the book remains to this day the all-time bestseller in Japan of non-fiction by a Western author. The book was timely: Japan's subsequent \"bubble era\" of the 1980s saw the country booming. But since the economic bubble burst at the start of the 1990s, Japan has been in decline. Japan Restored by Clyde Prestowitz, taking up Vogel's baton, is written as a vision of Japan in the year 2050, when the country's economic recovery has made it a world leader in every area of human endeavor. Prestowitz looks back to the year 2014 as such a low point for Japan that a special reform commission was set up that helped the country regain its former position as a leader in technology, in business, and geopolitically. Looking at education, innovation, the role of women, corporate organization, energy, infrastructure, domestic government, and international alliances Prestowitz draws up a fascinating and controversial blueprint for the future success of Japan.

Deeply associated with Japanese culture both past and present, it has often been thought of as a highly gendered, rigidly traditional and unchanging national costume. This book challenges that perception, revealing the nuanced meanings and messages behind the kimono from the point of view of its wearers and producers, many of whom - both men and women - see the garment as a vehicle for self-expression. Taking a material culture approach, The Social Life of Kimono is the first study to combine the history of the kimono as a fashionable garment with an in-depth exploration of its multifaceted role today on both the street and the catwalk. Through case studies covering historical advertising campaigns, fashion magazines, interviews with contemporary kimono designers, large scale and small craft producers, and consumers who choose to wear them, The Social Life of Kimono gives a unique insight into making and meaning of this complex garment\"--","subjects":["Kimonos","Clothing and dress — Social aspects — Japan","Clothing and dress — Social aspects"],"publisherName":"Bloomsbury Academic, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing Plc","publishedDate":"2017","resourceId":"98587259-d1ad-41a8-9666-0f05b29d8b25"},{"title":"Hidden atrocities","subtitle":"Japanese germ warfare and American obstruction of justice at the Tokyo Trial","authors":[{"authorName":"Guillemin, Jeanne","roleTerm":""}],"lcCallNumber":"KZ1181 .G85 2017","ddCallNumber":"341.6/90268","isbn":"9780231183529","abstract":"In the aftermath of World War II, the Allied intent to bring Axis crimes to light led to both the Nuremberg trials and their counterpart in Tokyo, the International Military Tribunal of the Far East failed to prosecute imperial Japanese leaders for the worst of war crimes: inhumane medical experimentation, including vivisection and open-air pathogen and chemical tests, which rivaled Nazi atrocities, as well as mass attacks using plague, anthrax, and cholera that killed thousands of Chinese civilians. In Hidden Atrocities, Jeanne Guillemin goes behind the scenes at the trial to reveal the American obstruction that denied justice to Japan's victims. Responsibility for Japan's secret germ-warfare program, organized as Unit 731 in Harbin, China, extended to top government leaders and many respected scientists, all of whom escaped indictment. Instead, motivated by early Cold War tensions, U.S. military intelligence in Tokyo insinuated itself into the Tokyo Trial by blocking prosecution access to key witnesses and then classifying incriminating documents. Washington decision makers, supported by the American occupation leader, General Douglas MacArthur, sought to acquire Japan's biological-warfare expertise to gain an advantage over the Soviet Union, suspected of developing both biological and nuclear weapons. Ultimately, U.S. national-security goals left the victims of Unit 731 without vindication. Decades later, evidence of the Unit 731 atrocities still troubles relations between China and Japan. Guillemin's vivid account of the cover-up at the Tokyo Trial shows how without guarantees of transparency, power politics can jeopardize international justice, with persistent consequences. -- Inside jacket flaps","subjects":["Tokyo Trial, Tokyo, Japan, 1946-1948","War crime trials — Japan","Biological weapons — History — Japan","Biological weapons","War crime trials"],"publisherName":"Columbia University Press","publishedDate":"","resourceId":"8d928f32-77c1-4d36-848c-9e1383be218a"},{"title":"Japan on the Silk Road","subtitle":"encounters and perspectives of politics and culture in Eurasia","authors":[{"authorName":"Esenbel, Selçuk","roleTerm":"editor"}],"lcCallNumber":"DS329.4 .J36 2018","ddCallNumber":"327.52058","isbn":"9789004274303","abstract":"\"Japan on the Silk Road provides the historical background indispensable for understanding today's Japan perspectives and policies in the vast area of Eurasia.

Born in Westphalia in 1651, Kaempfer traveled throughout the Near and Far East before settling in Japan as physician to the trading settlement of the Dutch East India Company at Nagasaki. During his two years residence, he made two extensive trips around Japan in 1691 and 1692, collecting, according to the British historian Boxer, \"an astonishing amount of valuable and accurate information.\" He also learned all he could from the few Japanese who came to Deshima for instruction in the European sciences.To these observations, Kaempfer added details he had gathered from a wide reading of travelers' accounts and the reports of previous trading delegations. The result was the first scholarly study of Tokugawa Japan in the West, a work that greatly influenced the European view of Japan throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, serving as a reference for a variety of works ranging from encyclopedias to the libretto of \"The Mikado.\"Kaempfer's work remains one of the most valuable sources for historians of the Tokugawa period. The narrative describes what no Japanese was permitted to record (the details of the shogun's castle, for example) and what no Japanese thought worthy of recording (the minutiae of everyday life). However, all previous translations of the History are flawed, being based on the work of an eighteenth-century Swiss translator or that of the German editor some fifty years later who had little knowledge of Japan and resented Kaempfer's praise of the heathen country. Beatrice Bodart-Bailey's impressive new translation of this classic, which reflects careful study of Kaempfer's original manuscript, reclaims the work for the modern reader, placing it in the context of what is currently known about Tokugawa Japan and restoring the humor and freshness of Kaempfer's observations and impressions.

Until conflict arose between Japan and the organization over the 1931 Manchurian Incident, the League was a centerpiece of Japan's policy to maintain accommodation with the Western powers. The picture of Japan as a positive contributor to international comity, however, is not the conventional view of the country in the early and mid-twentieth century. Rather, this period is usually depicted in Japan and abroad as a history of incremental imperialism and intensifying militarism, culminating in war in China and the Pacific. Even the empire's interface with the League of Nations is typically addressed only at nodes of confrontation: the 1919 debates over racial equality as the Covenant was drafted and the 1931-1933 League challenge to Japan's seizure of northeast China.This volume fills in the space before, between, and after these nodes and gives the League relationship the legitimate place it deserves in Japanese international history of the 1920s and 1930s. It also argues that the Japanese cooperative international stance in the decades since the Pacific War bears noteworthy continuity with the mainstream international accommodationism of the League years.Thomas Burkman sheds new light on the meaning and content of internationalism in an era typically seen as a showcase for diplomatic autonomy and isolation. Well into the 1930s, the vestiges of international accommodationism among diplomats and intellectuals are clearly evident. The League project ushered those it affected into world citizenship and inspired them to build bridges across boundaries and cultures.

Gilbert Rozman argues in Japan's Response to the Gorbachev Era, that Japanese perceptions of the Soviet Union are distinctive and are helpful for understanding what will become an influential worldview. Focusing on diverse opinion leaders and the relationship between the Japanese media, policy-making, and public opinion, Rozman shows how long-standing negative images of Soviet socialism and militarism have been reconsidered since the mid-1980s. His analysis treats burning issues such as the Northern Territories dispute, the Soviet commitment to reform, and the Soviet-American relationship. It also sheds light on Japanese views of Soviet history, modernization, and national character.

However, most international security politics involve coercive diplomacy and negotiations short of all-out war. Worse Than a Monolith demonstrates that when states are engaged in coercive diplomacy--combining threats and assurances to influence the behavior of real or potential adversaries--divisions, rivalries, and lack of coordination within the opposing camp often make it more difficult to prevent the onset of conflict, to prevent existing conflicts from escalating, and to negotiate the end to those conflicts promptly. Focusing on relations between the Communist and anti-Communist alliances in Asia during the Cold War, Thomas Christensen explores how internal divisions and lack of cohesion in the two alliances complicated and undercut coercive diplomacy by sending confusing signals about strength, resolve, and intent. In the case of the Communist camp, internal mistrust and rivalries catalyzed the movement's aggressiveness in ways that we would not have expected from a more cohesive movement under Moscow's clear control. Reviewing newly available archival material, Christensen examines the instability in relations across the Asian Cold War divide, and sheds new light on the Korean and Vietnam wars. While recognizing clear differences between the Cold War and post-Cold War environments, he investigates how efforts to adjust burden-sharing roles among the United States and its Asian security partners have complicated U.S.-China security relations since the collapse of the Soviet Union","subjects":["Alliances — History — 20th century","Foreign relations — Asia — 1945-"],"publisherName":"Princeton University Press,","publishedDate":"","resourceId":"9ba2b557-3c31-41ff-bf8a-e2a6667f8954"},{"title":"Bodies of memory","subtitle":"narratives of war in postwar Japanese culture, 1945-1970","authors":[{"authorName":"Igarashi, Yoshikuni","roleTerm":"creator"}],"lcCallNumber":"DS822.5 .I33 2000","ddCallNumber":"952.04","isbn":"1-283-37991-0","abstract":"Japan and the United States became close political allies so quickly after the end of World War II, that it seemed as though the two countries had easily forgotten the war they had fought. Here Yoshikuni Igarashi offers a provocative look at how Japanese postwar society struggled to understand its war loss and the resulting national trauma, even as forces within the society sought to suppress these memories. Igarashi argues that Japan's nationhood survived the war's destruction in part through a popular culture that expressed memories of loss and devastation more readily than political discourse ever could. He shows how the desire to represent the past motivated Japan's cultural productions in the first twenty-five years of the postwar period. Japanese war experiences were often described through narrative devices that downplayed the war's disruptive effects on Japan's history. Rather than treat these narratives as obstacles to historical inquiry, Igarashi reads them along with counter-narratives that attempted to register the original impact of the war. He traces the tensions between remembering and forgetting by focusing on the body as the central site for Japan's production of the past. This approach leads to fascinating discussions of such diverse topics as the use of the atomic bomb, hygiene policies under the U.S. occupation, the monstrous body of Godzilla, the first Western professional wrestling matches in Japan, the transformation of Tokyo and the athletic body for the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, and the writer Yukio Mishima's dramatic suicide, while providing a fresh critical perspective on the war legacy of Japan","subjects":["Civilization — Japan — 1945-"],"publisherName":"Princeton University Press","publishedDate":"2000","resourceId":"ef6da547-12f8-44f5-8493-7241ff487920"},{"title":"Seismic Japan","subtitle":"The Long History and Continuing Legacy of the Ansei Edo Earthquake","authors":[{"authorName":"Smits, Gregory","roleTerm":""}],"lcCallNumber":"QE537.2.J3 S54 2013","ddCallNumber":"551.220952","isbn":"0-8248-7099-9","abstract":"What are we to make of contemporary newspapers in Japan speculating about the possible connection between aquatic creatures and earthquakes? Of a city council deciding to issue evacuation advice based on observed animal behavior? Why, between 1977 and 1993, did Japan's government spend taxpayer money to observe catfish in aquariums as part of its mandate to fund earthquake prediction research? All of these actions are direct legacies of the 1855 Ansei Edo earthquake, one of the major natural disasters of the period. In his investigation of the science, politics, and lore of seismic events in Japan, Gregory Smits examines this earthquake in a broad historical context.The Ansei Edo earthquake shook the shogun's capital during a year of special religious significance and at a time of particularly vigorous seismic activity. It was also a turning point because, according to the prevailing understanding of earthquakes at the time, it should never have happened. Many Japanese, therefore, became receptive to new ideas about the causes of earthquakes as well as to the notion that by observing some phenomena-for example, the behavior of catfish-one might determine when an earthquake would strike. All subsequent major earthquakes in Japan resulted in claims, always made after the fact, that certain phenomena had been signs of the impending catastrophe. Indeed, earthquake prediction in Japan from 1855 to the present has largely consisted of amassing collections of alleged or possible precursor phenomena. In addition, the Ansei Edo earthquake served as a catalyst accelerating socio-political trends already underway. It revealed bakufu military weaknesses and enhanced the prestige of the imperial deity Amaterasu at the expense of the bakufu deity Kashima. Anyone interested in Japan, earthquakes, and natural disasters will benefit from Seismic Japan.

Faubion Bowers (1917-1999), who served as personal aide and interpreter to MacArthur during the Occupation, was appalled by the censorship policies and anticipated the extinction of a great theatrical art. He used his position in the Occupation administration and his knowledge of Japanese theatre in his tireless campaign to save kabuki. Largely through Bowers's efforts, censorship of kabuki had for the most part been eliminated by the time he left Japan in 1948. Although Bowers is at the center of the story, this lively and skillfully adapted translation from the original Japanese treats a critical period in the long history of kabuki as it was affected by a single individual who had a commanding influence over it. It offers fascinating and little-known details about Occupation censorship politics and kabuki performance while providing yet another perspective on the history of an enduring Japanese art form.Read Bowers' impressions of Gen.

These are not usually considered the “stuff” of modernism. More often they are regarded as inconsequential to the study of the modern, or, at best, seen as representative of traditional beliefs that are overcome and left behind in the transformation toward modernity. In Civilization and Monsters Gerald Figal asserts that discourse on the fantastic was at the heart of the historical configuration of Japanese modernity—that the representation of the magical and mysterious played an integral part in the production of modernity beginning in Meiji Japan (1868–1912).After discussing the role of the fantastic in everyday Japan at the eve of the Meiji period, Figal draws new connections between folklorists, writers, educators, state ideologues, and policymakers, all of whom crossed paths in a contest over supernatural terrain. He shows the ways in which a determined Meiji state was engaged in a battle to suppress, denigrate, manipulate, or reincorporate folk belief as part of an effort toward the consolidation of a modern national culture. Modern medicine and education, functioning as a means for the state to exercise its power, redefined folk practices as a source of evil. Diverse local spirits were supplanted by a new Japanese Spirit, embodied by the newly constituted emperor, the supernatural source of the nation’s strength. The monsters of folklore were identified, catalogued, and characterized according to a new regime of modern reason. But whether engaged to support state power and forge a national citizenry or to critique the arbitrary nature of that power, the fantastic, as Figal maintains, is the constant condition of Japanese modernity in all its contradictions. Furthermore, he argues, modernity in general is born of fantasy in ways that have scarcely been recognized.Bringing unexplored and provocative new ideas to the Japan specialist, Civilization and Monsters will also appeal to readers concerned with issues of modernity in general","subjects":[],"publisherName":"Duke University Press","publishedDate":"20000101","resourceId":"56dc8489-ff9a-4180-a80e-7daccef18514"},{"title":"Maiden voyage","subtitle":"the Senzaimaru and the creation of modern Sino-Japanese relations","authors":[{"authorName":"Fogel, Joshua A","roleTerm":""}],"lcCallNumber":"HF1602.15.C6 .F644 2014","ddCallNumber":"382/.95105209034","isbn":"0-520-95917-5","abstract":"After centuries of virtual isolation, during which time international sea travel was forbidden outside of Japan's immediate fishing shores, Japanese shogunal authorities in 1862 made the unprecedented decision to launch an official delegation to China by sea. Concerned by the fast-changing global environment, they had witnessed the ever-increasing number of incursions into Asia by European powers-not the least of which was Commodore Perry's arrival in Japan in 1853-54 and the forced opening of a handful of Japanese ports at the end of the decade. The Japanese reasoned that it was only a matter of time before they too encountered the same unfortunate fate as China; their hope was to learn from the Chinese experience and to keep foreign powers at bay. They dispatched the Senzaimaru to Shanghai with the purpose of investigating contemporary conditions of trade and diplomacy in the international city. Japanese from varied domains, as well as shogunal officials, Nagasaki merchants, and an assortment of deck hands, made the voyage along with a British crew, spending a total of ten weeks observing and interacting with the Chinese and with a handful of Westerners. Roughly a dozen Japanese narratives of the voyage were produced at the time, recounting personal impressions and experiences in Shanghai. The Japanese emissaries had the distinct advantage of being able to communicate with their Chinese hosts by means of the \"brush conversation\" (written exchanges in literary Chinese). For their part, the Chinese authorities also created a paper trail of reports and memorials concerning the Japanese visitors, which worked its way up and down the bureaucratic chain of command. This was the first official meeting of Chinese and Japanese in several centuries. Although the Chinese authorities agreed to few of the Japanese requests for trade relations and a consulate, nine years later China and Japan would sign the first bilateral treaty of amity in their history, a completely equal treaty.

Harootunian considers Japan’s fateful encounter with capitalist modernity and the implications of uneven development, examining the combinations of older practices with new demands that characterized the twentieth century. The book examines the making of modern Japan, the transformations of everyday life, and the collision between the production of forms of cultural expression and new political possibilities. Finally, Harootunian analyzes Japanese political identity and its forms of reckoning with the past.

Its nine chapters, diverse in theme and method, are united in their goal to recover a measured historicity about the conflict by either introducing new areas of knowledge or reinterpreting existing ones. Collectively, they cast doubt on the war as familiar and recognizable, compelling readers to view it with fresh eyes.Following an introduction that problematizes timeworn narratives about a \"unified Japan\" and its \"illegal war\" or \"race war,\" early chapters on the destruction of Japan's diplomatic records and government interest in an egalitarian health care policy before, during, and after the war oblige us to question selective histories and moral judgments about wartime Japan. The discussion then turns to artistic/cultural production and self-determination, specifically to Osaka rakugo performers who used comedy to contend with state oppression and to the role of women in creating care packages for soldiers abroad. Other chapters cast doubt on well-trod stereotypes (Japan's lack of pragmatism in its diplomatic relations with neutral nations and its irrational and fatalistic military leadership) and examine resistance to the war by a prominent Japanese Christian intellectual. The volume concludes with two nuanced responses to race in wartime Japan, one maintaining the importance of racial categories while recognizing the \"performance of Japaneseness,\" the other observing that communities often reflected official government policies through nationality rather than race. Contrasting findings like these underscore the need to ask new questions and fill old gaps in our understanding of a historical event that, after more than seventy years, remains as provocative and divisive as ever.Defamiliarizing Japan's Asia-Pacific War will find a ready audience among World War II historians as well as specialists in war and society, social history, and the growing fields of material culture and civic history","subjects":["Public opinion — Japan","World War, 1939-1945 — Historiography — Japan","World War, 1939-1945 — Public opinion — Japan"],"publisherName":"University of Hawaii Press,","publishedDate":"","resourceId":"60a4d19c-bc41-4662-bb25-2a374526c9f3"},{"title":"Kingdom of the Sick","subtitle":"A History of Leprosy and Japan","authors":[{"authorName":"Burns, Susan L","roleTerm":""}],"lcCallNumber":"","ddCallNumber":"616.99/800952","isbn":"9780824879488","abstract":"In this groundbreaking work, Susan L. Burns examines the history of leprosy in Japan from medieval times until the present. At the center of Kingdom of the Sick is the rise of Japan's system of national leprosy sanitaria, which today continue to house more than 1,500 former patients, many of whom have spent five or more decades within them. Burns argues that long before the modern Japanese government began to define a policy toward leprosy, the disease was already profoundly marked by ethical and political concerns and associated with sin, pollution, heredity, and outcast status. Beginning in the 1870s, new anxieties about race and civilization that emanated from a variety of civic actors, including journalists, doctors, patent medicine producers, and Christian missionaries transformed leprosy into a national issue. After 1900, a clamor of voices called for the quarantine of all sufferers of the disease, and in the decades that followed bureaucrats, politicians, physicians, journalists, local communities, and leprosy sufferers themselves grappled with the place of the biologically vulnerable within the body politic. At stake in this \"citizenship project\" were still evolving conceptions of individual rights, government responsibility for social welfare, and the delicate balance between care and control.Refusing to treat leprosy patients as simply victims of state power, Burns recovers their voices in the debates that surrounded the most controversial aspects of sanitarium policy, including the use of sterilization, segregation, and the continuation of confinement long after leprosy had become a curable disease. Richly documented with both visual and textual sources and interweaving medical, political, social, and cultural history, Kingdom of the Sick tells an important story for readers interested in Japan, the history of medicine and public health, social welfare, gender and sexuality, and human rights","subjects":["HISTORY / Asia / Japan"],"publisherName":"University of Hawaii Press,","publishedDate":"","resourceId":"a1be0ecd-1b6a-4566-b7a6-cb7f1da2dc0a"},{"title":"Kokutai No Hongi","subtitle":"Cardinal Principles of the National Entity of Japan","authors":[{"authorName":"Gauntlett, John Owen","roleTerm":""},{"authorName":"Hall, Robert King","roleTerm":"editor"},{"authorName":"Hall, Robert King","roleTerm":""}],"lcCallNumber":"DS821 .A16 1949","ddCallNumber":"915.2","isbn":"9780674284869","abstract":"","subjects":["National characteristics, Japanese"],"publisherName":"Harvard University Press,","publishedDate":"","resourceId":"e5f04760-fef8-4e73-9df5-fb6c811b58f0"},{"title":"Hara Kei in the Politics of Compromise, 1905-1915","subtitle":"","authors":[{"authorName":"Najita, Tetsuo","roleTerm":""}],"lcCallNumber":"DS884.H28","ddCallNumber":"952.03/2/0924","isbn":"9780674429048","abstract":"","subjects":[],"publisherName":"Harvard University Press,","publishedDate":"","resourceId":"c67e2892-62ad-4394-9300-ed0cc286a72d"},{"title":"The Enduring Art of Japan","subtitle":"","authors":[{"authorName":"Warner, Langdon","roleTerm":""}],"lcCallNumber":"","ddCallNumber":"709.52","isbn":"9780674865693","abstract":"","subjects":["Art — Japan"],"publisherName":"Harvard University Press,","publishedDate":"","resourceId":"a9c40980-7dfc-4730-9c2e-0a9f132bfb20"},{"title":"Immigrant Japan","subtitle":"mobility and belonging in an ethno-nationalist society","authors":[{"authorName":"Liu-Farrer, Gracia","roleTerm":""},{"authorName":"Project Muse","roleTerm":""}],"lcCallNumber":"JV8722 .L58 2020","ddCallNumber":"305.9/069120952","isbn":"9781501748639","abstract":"","subjects":["Immigrants — Japan","Group identity — Japan","Social integration — Japan","Citizenship — Japan","Citizenship","Emigration and immigration — Social aspects","Ethnic relations","Group identity","Immigrants","Social integration","Emigration and immigration — Social aspects — Japan","Ethnic relations — Japan"],"publisherName":"Cornell University Press","publishedDate":"2020","resourceId":"9ee67fb2-dce5-47cf-a9ae-ccd847769041"},{"title":"Situated Meaning","subtitle":"Inside and Outside in Japanese Self, Society, and Language","authors":[{"authorName":"Bachnik, Jane M","roleTerm":""},{"authorName":"Quinn, Charles J","roleTerm":""}],"lcCallNumber":"DS821","ddCallNumber":"952","isbn":"0-691-60854-7","abstract":"Situated Meaning adds a new dimension, both literal and metaphoric, to our understanding of Japan.

Middle-aged widows, the women made a living as mediums, healers, and fortune-tellers. Two of the men dabbled in divination; the third was a doctor who collected books in Chinese on Western learning and Christianity.This was a startling development. No one in Japan had been identified and punished as a Christian for more than a century, and now, avowed devotees of the proscribed sect had appeared in the very heart of the realm. Just decades before the arrival of Perry's black ships and the fall of the Tokugawa shogunate, the incident reignited fears of Christians as evil sorcerers, plotting to undermine society and overthrow the country.Christian Sorcerers on Trial offers annotated translations of a range of sources on this sensational event, from the 1827 arrest of the alleged Christians through the case's afterlife.

Severed from the country of their birth when the attack on Pearl Harbor abruptly halted all passenger traffic on the Pacific, these Nisei faced the years of total war as members of the Japanese populace, yet as the target of anti-American propaganda and suspicion. Whereas their white American counterparts were sequestered by Japanese authorities, placed on house arrest, or sent home on exchange ships during the war, American Nisei in Japan were left to contribute to the war effort alongside their Japanese neighbors as soldiers, cryptographers, interpreters, and in farming and manufacturing. When the dust of air raid bombings cleared, many such Nisei transitioned into roles in service of the Allied occupation and its goals of democratization and demilitarization. As censors, translators, interpreters, and administrative staff, they played integral roles in facilitating American-Japanese interaction, as well as in shaping policies and public opinion in the postwar era. Weaving archival data with oral histories, personal narratives, material culture, and fiction, Unthinking Collaboration emphasizes the heterogeneity of Japanese immigrant experiences, and sheds light on broader issues of identity, race, and performance of individuals growing up in a bicultural or multicultural context. By distancing “collaboration” from its default elision with moral judgment, and by incorporating contemporary findings from psychology and behavioral science about the power of the subconscious mind to influence human behavior, author A. Carly Buxton offers an alternative approach to history—one that posits historical subjects as deeply embedded in the realities of their physical and discursive environment. Walking beside Nisei as they navigate their everyday lives in transwar Japan, readers “un-think” long-held assumptions about the actions and decisions of individuals as represented in history. The result is an ambitious historical study that speaks to readers who are interested in broader questions of race and trust, empire-building, World War II and its legacy on both the Western and Pacific fronts, and to all who consider questions of loyalty, treason, assimilation, and collaboration","subjects":["Japanese Americans — Japan","World War, 1939-1945 — Japanese Americans"],"publisherName":"University of Hawaii Press,","publishedDate":"","resourceId":"ecb2ec2a-b34a-4d61-9528-143653a746ea"},{"title":"Life of Nobuko","subtitle":"Words, Works and Pictures of an Ordinary but Remarkable Japanese Woman, 1946-2015","authors":[{"authorName":"Kanasaka, Kiyonori","roleTerm":""}],"lcCallNumber":"","ddCallNumber":"","isbn":"9781898823896","abstract":"Kiyonori Kanasaka, a distinguished geographer at Kyoto University, is widely recognized as Japan’s leading researcher on the Victorian traveller Isabella Bird.

Waley was the single most important force in creating what the English-speaking public understood to be \"Japanese literature\" with his popular and critically acclaimed translations of Japanese poetry, Noh plays, and the celebrated eleventh-century court romance The Tale of Genji. Orienting Arthur Waley, the first book-length study of Waley and his Japanese translations, provides a provocative examination of Waley's contribution to twentieth-century English literature and culture. John de Gruchy examines how social contexts influenced Waley's work, and he further locates Waley's Japanese translations within the political contexts of the japonism movement, British socialism and imperialism, and the development of Japanese studies in England. How a \"cult of things Japanese\" in the early modern period in Britain led to the emergence of one of the twentieth century's most important translators is a fascinating story in itself. --Publisher description","subjects":["Japanese literature — Translations into English — History and criticism","Japanese language — Translations into English"],"publisherName":"University of Hawaii Press","publishedDate":"c2003","resourceId":"8bf0fbcf-f385-4950-86d5-50a1fa9b9656"},{"title":"Twenty plays of the Nō theatre","subtitle":"","authors":[{"authorName":"Keene, Donald","roleTerm":"creator"},{"authorName":"Tyler, Royall","roleTerm":""},{"authorName":"American Council of Learned Societies","roleTerm":""}],"lcCallNumber":"PL782.E5 K4","ddCallNumber":"895.6/2/208","isbn":"0-231-03454-7","abstract":"","subjects":["Nō plays","Japanese drama — Translations into English","English drama — Translations from Japanese","Nåo plays — Translations into English","Japanese drama"],"publisherName":"Columbia University Press","publishedDate":"c1970","resourceId":"c5ab46c9-7340-4f66-a38a-285e9676fe26"},{"title":"Kaichōon","subtitle":"","authors":[{"authorName":"Ueda, Bin","roleTerm":"creator"}],"lcCallNumber":"PL778 .U3 1969","ddCallNumber":"","isbn":"","abstract":"","subjects":["Poetry, Modern — Translations into Japanese","Japanese poetry — Translations from foreign literature"],"publisherName":"Tōji Shobō","publishedDate":"昭和 44 [1969]","resourceId":"41fd7bc9-ca06-4307-bb30-261993c398cc"},{"title":"Tokyo Central","subtitle":"a memoir","authors":[{"authorName":"Seidensticker, Edward","roleTerm":"creator"}],"lcCallNumber":"PL713 .S45 2002","ddCallNumber":"895.609 B","isbn":"0295981342 (alk. paper)","abstract":"\"In this memoir, Seidensticker tells of his introduction to Japan at the Navy Japanese Language School in 1942, at the age of twenty-one.

publication in multiple languages, the genre's form and aims are shifting. Born-translated novels include passages that appear to be written in different tongues, narrators who speak to foreign audiences, and other visual and formal techniques that treat translation as a medium rather than as an afterthought. These strategies challenge the global dominance of English, complicate \"native\" readership, and protect creative works against misinterpretation as they circulate. They have also given rise to a new form of writing that confounds traditional models of literary history and political community.Born Translated builds a much-needed framework for understanding translation's effect on fictional works, as well as digital art, avant-garde magazines, literary anthologies, and visual media. Artists and novelists discussed include J. M. Coetzee, Junot Díaz, Jonathan Safran Foer, Mohsin Hamid, Kazuo Ishiguro, Jamaica Kincaid, Ben Lerner, China Miéville, David Mitchell, Walter Mosley, Caryl Phillips, Adam Thirlwell, Amy Waldman, and Young-hae Chang Heavy Industries. The book understands that contemporary literature begins at once in many places, engaging in a new type of social embeddedness and political solidarity. It recasts literary history as a series of convergences and departures and, by elevating the status of \"born-translated\" works, redefines common conceptions of author, reader, and nation","subjects":["Fiction — History and criticism — Translations","Literature — Translations — History and criticism","Translating and interpreting"],"publisherName":"Columbia University Press,","publishedDate":"","resourceId":"69fc8398-72f2-4e4c-bc8e-2b380e66a59f"},{"title":"Anthology of Japanese literature, from the earliest era to the mid-nineteenth century","subtitle":"","authors":[{"authorName":"Keene, Donald","roleTerm":""}],"lcCallNumber":"PL882 .K4 1960","ddCallNumber":"","isbn":"","abstract":"This extensive anthology includes excerpts from plays and novels plus stories, fairy tales, and many poems","subjects":["Japanese literature — Translations into English","English literature — Translations from Japanese"],"publisherName":"Grove Press","publishedDate":"[1960, c1955]","resourceId":"38e4ab68-45e0-435e-af8f-1a4e71e1577c"},{"title":"Anthology of Japanese literature, from the earliest era to the mid-nineteenth century","subtitle":"","authors":[{"authorName":"Keene, Donald","roleTerm":""}],"lcCallNumber":"PL782.E1 K38 1956","ddCallNumber":"895.609","isbn":"","abstract":"","subjects":["Japanese literature — Translations into English","English literature — Translations from Japanese"],"publisherName":"G.

A self-taught folk scholar and elite bureaucrat, he promoted folk studies in Japan. So extensive was his role that he has been compared with the fabled Grimm Brothers of Germany and the great British folklorist James G. Frazer (1854-1941), author of The Golden Bough. This monograph is only the second book-length English-language examination of Yanagita, and it is the first analysis that moves beyond a biographical account of his pioneering work in folk studies. An eccentric but insightful critic of Japan's rush to modernize, Yanagita offers a compelling array of rebuttals to mainstream social and political trends in his carefully crafted writings. Through a close reading of Yanagita's interdisciplinary texts, which comment on a wide range of key cultural issues that characterized the first half of Japan's twentieth century, Melek Ortabasi seeks to reevaluate the historical significance of his work. Ortabasi's inquiry simultaneously exposes, discursively, some of the fundamental assumptions we embrace about modernity and national identity in Japan and elsewhere.\"--Amazon","subjects":["Criticism and interpretation","Folklorists — Japan","Translating and interpreting — History — Japan","National characteristics, Japanese, in literature","Modernism (Literature) — Japan"],"publisherName":"Harvard University Asia Center","publishedDate":"2014","resourceId":"85393b31-8dbe-4ff4-be1d-0afef731be4e"},{"title":"Great Fool","subtitle":"Zen Master Ryōkan; Poems, Letters, and Other Writings","authors":[{"authorName":"Abe, Ryuichi","roleTerm":""},{"authorName":"Haskel, Peter","roleTerm":""}],"lcCallNumber":"PL797.6.Z5.R8 1996eb","ddCallNumber":"895.6134","isbn":"0-8248-6270-8","abstract":"Taigu Ryokan (1759-1831) remains one of the most popular figures in Japanese Buddhist history. Despite his religious and artistic sophistication, Ryokan referred to himself as \"Great Fool\" and refused to place himself within the cultural elite of his age. In contrast to the typical Zen master of his time, who presided over a large monastery, trained students, and produced recondite religious treatises, Ryokan followed a life of mendicancy in the countryside. Instead of delivering sermons, he expressed himself through kanshi (poems composed in classical Chinese) and waka and could typically be found playing with the village children in the course of his daily rounds of begging. Great Fool is the first study in a Western language to offer a comprehensive picture of the legendary poet-monk and his oeuvre. It includes not only an extensive collection of the master's kanshi, topically arranged to facilitate an appreciation of Ryokan's colorful world, but selections of his waka, essays, and letters. The volume also presents for the first time in English the Ryokan zenji kiwa (Curious Accounts of the Zen Master Ryokan), a firsthand source composed by a former student less than sixteen years after Ryokan's death. Although it lacks chronological order, the Curious Account is invaluable for showing how Ryokan was understood and remembered by his contemporaries. It consists of colorful anecdotes and episodes, sketches from Ryokan's everyday life. To further assist the reader, three introductory essays approach Ryokan from the diverse perspectives of his personal history and literary work","subjects":["Zen poetry, Japanese — Translations into English"],"publisherName":"University of Hawaii Press,","publishedDate":"","resourceId":"86ead36b-3647-4501-b15a-54c32134a10e"},{"title":"The Forbidden Worlds of Haruki Murakami","subtitle":"","authors":[{"authorName":"Strecher, Matthew Carl","roleTerm":"creator"}],"lcCallNumber":"PL856 .U673 Z864 2014","ddCallNumber":"895.6 895.635","isbn":"1-4529-4305-2","abstract":"In an \"other world\" composed of language-it could be a fathomless Martian well, a labyrinthine hotel or forest-a narrative unfolds, and with it the experiences, memories, and dreams that constitute reality for Haruki Murakami's characters and readers alike.
