The Japanese themselves are conscious of the lush green of their homeland, which they sometimes refer to as \"the green archipelago.\" Yet, based on its fragile geography and centuries of extremely dense human occupation, Japan today should be an impoverished, slum-ridden, peasant society subsisting on a barren, eroded moonscape characterized by bald mountains and debris-strewn lowlands.In fact, as Conrad Totman argues in this pathbreaking work based on prodigious research, this lush verdue is not a monument to nature's benevolence and Japanese aesthetic sensibilities, but the hard-earned result of generations of human toil that have converted the archipelago into one great forest preserve. Indeed, the author shows that until the late 1600s Japan was well on her way to ecological disaster due to exploitative forestry. During the Tokugawa period, however, an extraordinary change took place resulting in a system of \"regenerative forestry\" that averted the devastation of Japan's forests. The Green Archipelago is the only major Western-language work on this subject and a landmark not only in Japanese history, but in the history of the environment."},"tableOfContents":"Frontmatter --  Contents --  Illustrations --  Preface --  A Brief Chronology --  Maps --  Introduction: An Overview of Preindustrial Japanese Forest History --  Part One.

For most of Japan's musical history, however, no such role existed-composition and performance were deeply intertwined. Only when Japan began to embrace Western culture in the late nineteenth century did the role of the composer emerge. In Composing Japanese Musical Modernity, Bonnie Wade uses an investigation of this new musical role to offer new insights not just into Japanese music but Japanese modernity at large and global cosmopolitan culture. Wade examines the short history of the composer in Japanese society, looking at the creative and economic opportunities that have sprung up around them-or that they forged-during Japan's astonishingly fast modernization. She shows that modernist Japanese composers have not bought into the high modernist concept of the autonomous artist, instead remaining connected to the people. Articulating Japanese modernism in this way, Wade tells a larger story of international musical life, of the spaces in which tradition and modernity are able to meet and, ultimately, where modernity itself has been made."},"tableOfContents":"Frontmatter -- Table of Contents -- Acknowledgments -- Introduction -- Part One: Composers in the Infrastructures of Japanese Modernity -- Part Two: Japanese Composers in Shared Cultural Spaces of Western Music -- Part Three: The Presence in Japan of European Spheres of Musical Participation -- Conclusion -- Chronology -- Notes -- Glossary -- Bibliography -- Index","targetAudience":{"@authority":"marctarget","#text":"specialized"},"note":[{"@type":"statement of responsibility","#text":"Bonnie C.

The households studied here differ in locale and in status-from samurai to outcaste, peasant to merchant-but what unites them is life within the social order of the Tokugawa shogunate. The circumstances and choices that made one household unlike another were framed, then as now, by prevailing laws, norms, and controls on resources. These factors led the majority to form stem families, which are a focus of this volume. The essays in this book draw on rich sources-population registers, legal documents, personal archives, and popular literature-to combine accounts of collective practices (such as the adoption of heirs) with intimate portraits of individual actors (such as a murderous wife). They highlight the variety and adaptability of households that, while shaped by a shared social order, do not conform to any stereotypical version of a Japanese family."},"tableOfContents":"Frontmatter --  Contents --  Lists of Illustrations and Tables --  A Note to Readers --  Introduction --  PART ONE.

They retain, in other words, a faith in state competence. For this faith, they adduce no evidence. Sharing little skepticism about the government's ability, they continue to expect the best of governmental intervention. To study government competence in World War II Japan offers an intriguing laboratory. In this book, Yoshiro Miwa shows that the Japanese government did not conduct requisite planning for the war by any means. It made its choices on an ad hoc basis and the war itself quickly became a dead end.

their vivid, and sometimes surprising perspectives on Americans and American society. Peter Duus and Kenji Hasegawa have selected essays and articles by Japanese from many walks of life: writers and academics, bureaucrats and priests, politicians and journalists, businessmen, philanthropists, artists. Their views often reflect power relations between America and Japan, particularly during the wartime and postwar periods, but all of them dealt with common themes-America's origins, its ethnic diversity, its social conformity, its peculiar gender relations, its vast wealth, and its cultural arrogance-making clear that while Japanese observers often regarded the U.S. as a mentor, they rarely saw it as a role model."},"tableOfContents":"Frontmatter --  Contents --  Illustrations --  Acknowledgments --  Introduction --  Chapter 1.

This familiar story of seclusion, argues master historian Marius B. Jansen, results from viewing the period soley in terms of Japan's ties with the West, at the expense of its relationship with closer Asian neighbors. Taking as his focus the port of Nagasaki and its thriving trade with China in the sixteenth through nineteenth centuries, Jansen not only corrects this misperception but offers an important analysis of the impact of the China trade on Japan's cultural, economic, and political life.

Thomas Keirstead argues that estates, or shoen, constituted more than a type of landownership. Through an examination of rent rolls, land registers, maps, and other data describing individual estates he reveals a cultural framework, one that produced and shaped meaning for residents and proprietors. Keirstead's discussion of peasant uprisings shows that the system, however, did not define a stable, closed structure, but was built upon contested terrain. Drawing on the works of Foucault,de Certeau, and Geertz, among others,this book illuminates the presuppositions about space and society that underwrote estate holding. It traces how the system reordered the social and physical landscape, establishing identity for both rulers and subjects. Estate holders, seeking to counter the fluid movement of populations across estate boundaries, pressed into service a social distinction between \"peasants\" and \"wanderers.\" Peasant rebels made use of the fiction that the estate comprised a natural community in order to resist proprietorial exactions. In these instances, Keirstead contends, the estate system reveals its governing logic: social and political divisions were articulated in spatial terms; power was exercised (and contested) through geography.Originally published in 1992.The Princeton Legacy Library uses the latest print-on-demand technology to again make available previously out-of-print books from the distinguished backlist of Princeton University Press.

Since the end of the Occupation, Japanese conservatives have sought to restore State Shinto's institutions even as expanded military budgets have placed Japan among the top five countries in defense spending. This timely book focuses on the struggles against government attempts to revive \"the emperor system\" and Japan's prewar military presence. Organized around case studies and based on extensive interviews, To Dream treats the operations of the Japanese court system thoroughly and uncovers important cases regarding religious liberty that remain little known even among specialists on modern Japanese history and society. It shows that litigation has been brought by pacifists, liberals, and others fiercely opposed to renewed militarism and to governmental support for the symbolism and institutions of State Shinto. Throughout, the author offers important information on the composition of courts involved and the attitudes of specific judges and provides translated texts of significant judicial decisions, in the process dispelling the stereotype of the Japanese as \"reluctant litigants.\""},"tableOfContents":"Frontmatter --  Contents --  Preface --  Acknowledgments --  Chapter 1.

Access publishing program. Visit www.luminosoa.org to learn more.The Hasegawa Reader is an open access companion to the bilingual catalogue copublished with The Noguchi Museum to accompany an international touring exhibition, Changing and Unchanging Things: Noguchi and Hasegawa in Postwar Japan. The exhibition features the work of two artists who were friends and contemporaries: Isamu Noguchi and Saburo Hasegawa. This volume is intended to give scholars and general readers access to a wealth of archival material and writings by and about Saburo Hasegawa. While Noguchi's reputation as a preeminent American sculptor of the twentieth century only grows stronger, Saburo Hasegawa is less well known, despite being considered the most literate artist in Japan during his lifetime (1906-1957). Hasegawa is credited with introducing abstraction in Japan in the mid 1930s, and he worked as an artist in diverse media including oil and ink painting, photography, and printmaking. He was also a theorist and widely published essayist, curator, teacher, and multilingual conversationalist. This valuable trove of Hasegawa material includes the entire manuscript for a 1957 Hasegawa memorial volume, with its beautiful essays by philosopher Alan Watts, Oakland Museum Director Paul Mills, and Japan Times art writer Elise Grilli, as well as various unpublished writings by Hasegawa. The ebook edition will also include a dozen essays by Hasegawa from the postwar period, and one prewar essay, professionally translated for this publication to give a sense of Hasegawa's voice. This resource will be an invaluable tool for scholars and students interested in midcentury East Asian and American art and tracing the emergence of contemporary issues of hybridity, transnationalism, and notions of a \"global Asia.\";"},"tableOfContents":"Frontmatter --  Contents --  Illustrations --  Preface --  Acknowledgments --  Introduction --  Note on Translation --  Saburo Hasegawa: A Brief Biography --  Part I.

While this concept has proved useful, students of the period in more recent years have sought alternative ways of understanding the late Meiji-Taisho period. This collection of essays, each based on new research, offers original insights into various aspects of modern Japanese cultural history from \"modernist\" architecture to women as cultural symbols, popular songs to the rhetoric of empire-building, and more. The volume is organized around three general topics: geographical and cultural space; cosmopolitanism and national identity; and diversity, autonomy, and integration. Within these the authors have identified a number of thematic tensions that link the essays: high and low culture in cultural production and dissemination; national and ethnic identities; empire and ethnicity; the center and the periphery; naichi (homeland) and gaichi (overseas); urban and rural; public and private; migration and barriers. The volume opens up new avenues of exploration for the study of modern Japanese history and culture. If, as one of the authors contends, the imperative is \" to understand more fully the historical forces that made Japan what it is today,\" these studies of Japan's \"competing modernities\" point the way to answers to some of the country's most challenging historical questions in this century.

This book analyses our condition by looking at the work of two great thinkers, one of whom provides a deep historical perspective, the other a wide comparative analysis. F.W. Maitland (1850-1906) was more than the greatest professional historian of modern times, he was a philosopher who provides a brilliant sketch of how our strange world has come about, particularly in his work on associations and trusts. Yukichi Fukuzawa (1835-1901) more than any other created the institutions of modern Japan. As an outsider he provides a brilliant insight into the heart of the new capitalist and industrial civilization which had emerged in the west."},"tableOfContents":"Machine generated contents note: 1.

Luminos, University of California Press's Open Access publishing program. Visit www.luminosoa.org to learn more.The Hasegawa Reader is an open access companion to the bilingual catalogue copublished with The Noguchi Museum to accompany an international touring exhibition, Changing and Unchanging Things: Noguchi and Hasegawa in Postwar Japan. The exhibition features the work of two artists who were friends and contemporaries: Isamu Noguchi and Saburo Hasegawa. This volume is intended to give scholars and general readers access to a wealth of archival material and writings by and about Saburo Hasegawa. While Noguchi's reputation as a preeminent American sculptor of the twentieth century only grows stronger, Saburo Hasegawa is less well known, despite being considered the most literate artist in Japan during his lifetime (1906-1957). Hasegawa is credited with introducing abstraction in Japan in the mid 1930s, and he worked as an artist in diverse media including oil and ink painting, photography, and printmaking. He was also a theorist and widely published essayist, curator, teacher, and multilingual conversationalist. This valuable trove of Hasegawa material includes the entire manuscript for a 1957 Hasegawa memorial volume, with its beautiful essays by philosopher Alan Watts, Oakland Museum Director Paul Mills, and Japan Times art writer Elise Grilli, as well as various unpublished writings by Hasegawa. The ebook edition will also include a dozen essays by Hasegawa from the postwar period, and one prewar essay, professionally translated for this publication to give a sense of Hasegawa's voice. This resource will be an invaluable tool for scholars and students interested in midcentury East Asian and American art and tracing the emergence of contemporary issues of hybridity, transnationalism, and notions of a \"global Asia.\";"},"tableOfContents":"Frontmatter -- Contents -- Illustrations -- Preface -- Acknowledgments -- Introduction -- Note on Translation -- Saburo Hasegawa: A Brief Biography -- 1.

The Japanese government legalized abortion in 1948 but did not approve the pill until 1999. In this carefully researched study, Tiana Norgren argues that these contradictory policies flowed from very different historical circumstances and interest group configurations. Doctors and family planners used a small window of opportunity during the Occupation to legalize abortion, and afterwards, doctors and women battled religious groups to uphold the law. The pill, on the other hand, first appeared at an inauspicious moment in history. Until circumstances began to change in the mid-1980s, the pharmaceutical industry was the pill's lone champion: doctors, midwives, family planners, and women all opposed the pill as a potential threat to their livelihoods, abortion rights, and women's health. Clearly written and interwoven with often surprising facts about Japanese history and politics, Norgren's book fills vital gaps in the cross-national literature on the politics of reproduction, a subject that has received more attention in the European and American contexts. Abortion Before Birth Control will be a valuable resource for those interested in abortion and contraception policies, gender studies, modern Japanese history, political science, and public policy."},"tableOfContents":"Ch. 1.

The households studied here differ in locale and in status-from samurai to outcaste, peasant to merchant-but what unites them is life within the social order of the Tokugawa shogunate. The circumstances and choices that made one household unlike another were framed, then as now, by prevailing laws, norms, and controls on resources. These factors led the majority to form stem families, which are a focus of this volume. The essays in this book draw on rich sources-population registers, legal documents, personal archives, and popular literature-to combine accounts of collective practices (such as the adoption of heirs) with intimate portraits of individual actors (such as a murderous wife). They highlight the variety and adaptability of households that, while shaped by a shared social order, do not conform to any stereotypical version of a Japanese family.

These magazines served to embed new instruments of mass communication and socialization within Japanese society and created mechanisms to facilitate the dissemination of hegemonic forms of discourse in Japan in the first half of the twentieth century. The amazing success of Kingu and Ie no hikari during the 1920s and 1930s not only established and normalized participation in a Japanese mass national audience - a community which had previously not existed - but also facilitated the rise of Japanese mass consumer culture in the postwar years. Amy Bliss Marshall argues that the postwar mass Japanese national consumer is foreshadowed by the mass national audience created by family magazines of the interwar era. This book analytically narrates the creation and development of such publications, one explicitly capitalist and one outwardly agrarian, based on missions with an overarching desire to create a mass Japanese magazine audience. Magazines & the Making of Mass Culture in Japan highlights the importance of the seemingly innocuous acts of mass, leisure consumption of magazines and the goods advertised therein, thus aiding our understanding of the creation and direction of a new form of social participation and understanding - an essential part of not only the culture but also the politics of the transwar period."},"tableOfContents":"Frontmatter --  Contents --  Table and Chart --  List of Illustrations --  Acknowledgments --  Introduction: Why Japanese Family Magazines Matter --  1.

Rather than viewing the process of normalization and rejuvenation as two decades of remilitarization in face of rapidly changing strategic environment and domestic political circumstances, this volume contextualizes Japan’s contemporary international relations against the longer grain of Japanese historical interactions. It demonstrates that policies and statecraft in the Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s era are a continuation of a long, unbroken and arduous effort by successive generations of leaders to preserve Japanese autonomy, enhance security and advance Japanese national interests. Arguing against the notion that Japan cannot work with China as long as the US-Japan alliance is in place, the book suggests that Tokyo could forge constructive relations with Beijing by engaging China in joint projects in and outside of the Asia-Pacific in issue areas such as infrastructure development or in the provision of international public goods. It also submits that an improvement in Japan-China relations would enhance rather than detract Japan-US relations and that Tokyo will find that her new found automony in the US-Japan alliance would not only accord her more political respect and strategic latitude, but also allow her to ameliorate the excesses of American foreign policy adventurism, paving for her to become a truly normal great power."},"tableOfContents":"1.

Christian Utz provides the foundations of a global music historiography, building on new models such as transnationalism, entangled histories, and reflexive globalization. The relationship between music and broader changes in society is placed at the center of attention and considered a pivotal music-historical dynamic."},"tableOfContents":"Frontmatter --  Table of Contents --  Preface --  Preface to the Revised and Expanded English Edition --  Acknowledgements --  List of Examples, Figures, and Tables --  I.

During these critical years in the Cold War in Asia, with the Vietnam War raging and the acquisition by China of a nuclear capability, Satō closely aligned with the US. This directly contributed to his success in securing the reversion of Okinawa and other Japanese territories which had remained under US control since Japan’s surrender at the end of World War II. To accomplish this he was also forced to conclude secret agreements with President Richard Nixon, including one on nuclear weapons, which are explored fully. Satō faced the challenge of the Nixon administration’s attempts to shore up the relative decline in American power with policies at odds with allied interests. Satō successfully overcame such challenges and also laid the groundwork for Japan’s anti-nuclear policy."},"tableOfContents":"Satō's first year in power, 1964-1965 -- Maturity, reversion and a year of crises, 1966-1968 -- The reversion of Okinawa, 1969, part 1 -- The reversion of Okinawa, 1969, part 2 -- The reversion of Okinawa, 1968, part 3 -- The Nixon Doctrine and Japan's defence policy, 1969-1971 -- The Nixon China shock, 1971 -- Economic woes, 1971-1972.","note":[{"@type":"statement of responsibility","#text":"by Fintan Hoey."},"Description based upon print version of record.",{"@type":"bibliography","#text":"Includes bibliographical references and index."},{"@type":"language","#text":"English"}],"subject":[{"geographicCode":[{"@authority":"marcgac","#text":"a-ja---"},{"@authority":"marcgac","#text":"n-us---"}]},{"@authority":"lcsh","name":{"@type":"personal","namePart":["Satō, Eisaku",{"@type":"date","#text":"1901-1975"}]}},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":"America—History"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":"Military history"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":"Asia—History"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":"World politics"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":"History, Modern"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":"Japan—History"},{"topic":"History of the Americas"},{"topic":"History of Military"},{"topic":"Asian History"},{"topic":"Political History"},{"topic":"Modern History"},{"topic":"History of Japan"},{"@authority":"lcsh","geographic":["Japan","United States"],"topic":"Foreign relations"},{"@authority":"lcsh","geographic":["United States","Japan"],"topic":"Foreign relations"},{"@authority":"lcsh","geographic":"Japan","topic":"Foreign relations","temporal":"1945-1989"},{"@authority":"lcsh","geographic":"United States","topic":"Foreign relations","temporal":"1963-1969"},{"@authority":"lcsh","geographic":"United States","topic":"Foreign relations","temporal":"1969-1974"},{"@authority":"lcsh","geographic":"Okinawa Island (Japan)","topic":"History","temporal":"20th century"}],"classification":[{"@authority":"lcc","#text":"E16-E18.85"},{"@authority":"ddc","#text":"327.7305209/046"}],"relatedItem":[{"titleInfo":{"title":"Security, Conflict and Cooperation in the Contemporary World"}},null,null,{"@type":"series","titleInfo":{"title":"Security, Conflict and Cooperation in the Contemporary World"}},{"@otherType":"HOLLIS record","location":{"url":"https://id.lib.harvard.edu/alma/99154273921803941/catalog"}}],"identifier":[{"@type":"isbn","#text":"1-137-45763-5"},{"@type":"doi","#text":"10.1057/9781137457639"}],"location":[null,null],"extension":[{"librarycloud":{"originalDocument":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/harvard.librarycloud.marc/99154273921803941","processingDate":"2022-07-14T05:13Z"}},{"sets":null}],"recordInfo":{"recordCreationDate":{"@encoding":"marc","#text":"160103"},"recordChangeDate":{"@encoding":"iso8601","#text":"20200919"},"recordIdentifier":{"@source":"MH:ALMA","#text":"99154273921803941"},"recordOrigin":"Converted from MARCXML to MODS version 3.6 using MARC21slim2MODS3-6.xsl\n        (Revision 1.117 2017/02/14)"}},{"titleInfo":{"nonSort":"The  ","title":"Meiji Restoration","subTitle":"Monarchism, Mass Communication and Conservative Revolution"},"name":{"@type":"personal","namePart":"Swale, Alistair D.","role":[{"roleTerm":{"@type":"text","#text":"creator"}},{"roleTerm":{"@type":"text","#text":"author."}},{"roleTerm":{"@type":"code","@authority":"marcrelator","#text":"aut"}},{"roleTerm":{"@type":"code","@authority":"marcrelator","#text":"http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/aut"}}]},"typeOfResource":"text","genre":[{"@authority":"marcgt","#text":"government publication"},"text"],"originInfo":[{"place":{"placeTerm":[{"@authority":"marccountry","@type":"code","#text":"xxk"},{"@authority":"marccountry","@type":"text","#text":"United Kingdom"}]},"dateIssued":{"@encoding":"marc","#text":"2009"},"edition":"1st ed. 2009.","issuance":"monographic"},{"place":{"placeTerm":{"@type":"text","#text":"London :"}},"publisher":"Palgrave Macmillan UK :","dateIssued":"2009."}],"language":{"languageTerm":[{"@authority":"iso639-2b","@type":"code","#text":"eng"},{"@authority":"iso639-2b","@type":"text","#text":"English"}]},"physicalDescription":{"form":[{"@authority":"gmd","#text":"electronic resource"},{"@authority":"marccategory","#text":"electronic resource"},{"@authority":"marcsmd","#text":"remote"},{"@type":"media","@authority":"","#text":"computer"},{"@type":"carrier","@authority":"","#text":"online resource"}],"extent":"1 online resource (217 p.)"},"abstract":{"@type":"Summary","#text":"The Meiji Restoration of 1868 is one of the most astonishing political events of the modern era, yet it doesn't fit easily with Western precedents of mass mobilization and social transformation.

Yet the origins of this community have been obscured. The English-language library is threadbare while Japanese scholars routinely insist that life outside of Japan was filled with shock and hardship so that, as one historian asserted, 'their bodies were in Brazil but their minds were always in Japan'. This study redraws the world of the overseas Japanese. Using the Japanese-language press of Brazil, it explains the development of a community with its own, often aggressively independent or ironic views of identity, institutions, education, leisure, and on Japan itself. Emphasising the success of Japanese migrants and the openness of Brazilian society, it challenges the perceived wisdom that contact between Japanese and other peoples was always marked by hostility and racism."},"note":[{"@type":"statement of responsibility","#text":"by S.

They were descendants of Japan's first Christians, the survivors of brutal religious persecution under the Tokugawa government. The Kakure Kirishitan, or \"hidden Christians,\" had practiced their religion in secret for several hundred years. Sometime after their visit the priest received a copy of the Kakure bible, the Tenchi Hajimari no Koto, \"Beginning of Heaven and Earth,\" an intriguing amalgam of Bible stories, Japanese fables, and Roman Catholic doctrine. Whelan offers a complete translation of this unique work accompanied by an illuminating commentary that provides the first theory of origin and evolution of the Tenchi. Today, the few Kakure Kirishitan communities still in existence view the Tenchi as strange and flawed, expressing a distorted form of Christianity. It is, however, the only text produced by the Kakure Kirishitan that depicts their highly syncretistic tradition and provides a colorful window through which to examine the dynamics of religious acculturation."},"tableOfContents":"Frontmatter --  Contents --  Preface --  Acknowledgments --  Manuscript List --  Introduction --  The Beginning of Heaven and Earth --  Notes --  Bibliography --  Index","targetAudience":{"@authority":"marctarget","#text":"specialized"},"note":[{"@type":"statement of responsibility","#text":"Christal Whelan."},"Description based upon print version of record.",{"@type":"language","#text":"English"}],"subject":[{"topic":"Catholic Church -- Japan -- Membership"},{"topic":"Crypto-Christians -- Japan"},{"topic":"Japan -- Church history"},{"topic":"Kakure Kirishitan"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":"Crypto-Christians","geographic":"Japan"},{"@authority":"HILCC","topic":"Religion"},{"@authority":"HILCC","topic":"Philosophy & Religion"},{"@authority":"HILCC","topic":"Christianity"}],"classification":[{"@authority":"lcc","#text":"BX1668 -- .T4513 1996eb"},{"@edition":"20","@authority":"ddc","#text":"275.2/08"},{"@authority":"rvk","#text":"EI 7770"}],"relatedItem":[null,{"@otherType":"HOLLIS record","location":{"url":"https://id.lib.harvard.edu/alma/99153552227903941/catalog"}}],"identifier":[{"@type":"isbn","#text":"0-8248-6160-4"},{"@type":"doi","#text":"10.1515/9780824861605"},{"@type":"oclc","#text":"45843023"},{"@type":"oclc","#text":"1021217283"},{"@type":"oclc","#text":"1029826400"},{"@type":"oclc","#text":"1032679333"},{"@type":"oclc","#text":"1037929132"},{"@type":"oclc","#text":"1041914600"},{"@type":"oclc","#text":"1045591040"}],"location":[null,null],"extension":[{"librarycloud":{"originalDocument":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/harvard.librarycloud.marc/99153552227903941","processingDate":"2022-05-13T05:10Z"}},{"sets":null}],"recordInfo":{"descriptionStandard":"rda","recordContentSource":{"@authority":"marcorg","#text":"DE-B1597"},"recordCreationDate":{"@encoding":"marc","#text":"190828"},"recordChangeDate":{"@encoding":"iso8601","#text":"20210114"},"recordIdentifier":{"@source":"MH:ALMA","#text":"99153552227903941"},"recordOrigin":"Converted from MARCXML to MODS version 3.6 using MARC21slim2MODS3-6.xsl\n        (Revision 1.117 2017/02/14)","languageOfCataloging":{"languageTerm":{"@authority":"iso639-2b","@type":"code","#text":"eng"}}}},{"titleInfo":[{"title":"OECD Economic Surveys"},{"@type":"alternative","title":"OECD Economic Surveys"},{"@type":"alternative","title":"Japan"}],"name":[{"@type":"personal","namePart":"Publishing, OECD.","role":{"roleTerm":{"@type":"text","#text":"creator"}}},{"@type":"corporate","namePart":"Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Staff","role":[{"roleTerm":{"@type":"text","#text":"creator"}},{"roleTerm":{"@type":"text","#text":"Corporate Author"}}]}],"typeOfResource":"text","genre":[{"@authority":"marcgt","#text":"government publication"},"text",{"@authority":"0","#text":"Electronic books."}],"originInfo":{"place":{"placeTerm":{"@type":"text","#text":"Paris"}},"publisher":"OECD Publishing","dateIssued":"2015","issuance":"monographic"},"language":{"languageTerm":[{"@authority":"iso639-2b","@type":"code","#text":"eng"},{"@authority":"iso639-2b","@type":"text","#text":"English"}]},"physicalDescription":{"form":[{"@authority":"marcform","#text":"electronic"},{"@authority":"gmd","#text":"electronic resource"},{"@authority":"marccategory","#text":"electronic resource"},{"@authority":"marcsmd","#text":"remote"},{"@type":"media","@authority":"","#text":"computer"},{"@type":"carrier","@authority":"","#text":"online resource"}],"extent":"1 online resource (309 p.)"},"tableOfContents":"Title page; Legal and rights; Foreword; Executive summary; Assessment and recommendations; Annex Progress in structural reforms; Thematic chapters; Chapter 1.

Gender, Culture, and Disaster in Post-3.11 Japan re-frames post-disaster national reconstruction as a social project imbued with dynamics of gender, race, and empire and in doing so Mire Koikari offers an innovative approach to resilience building in contemporary Japan. From juvenile literature to civic manuals to policy statements, Koikari examines a vast array of primary sources to demonstrate how femininity and masculinity, readiness and preparedness, militarism and humanitarianism, and nationalism and transnationalism inform cultural formation and transformation triggered by the unprecedented crisis. Interdisciplinary in its orientation, the book reveals how militarism, neoliberalism, and neoconservatism drive Japan's resilience building while calling attention to historical precedents and transnational connections that animate the ongoing mobilization toward safety and security. An important contribution to studies of gender and Japan, the book is essential reading for all those wishing to understand local and global politics of precarity and its proposed solutions amid the rising tide of pandemics, ecological hazards, industrial disasters, and humanitarian crises\"--"},"tableOfContents":"Introduction: rethinking Japanese culture since 3.11 -- Re-masculinizing the nation: resilient manhood and revitalized nationhood -- Training women for disaster: domesticity and preparedness in the age of uncertainty -- Securitizing childhood: children and disaster readiness education -- Mobilizing the paradise: Hawai'i in post-disaster national imagination.","note":[{"@type":"statement of responsibility","#text":"Mire Koikari."},{"@type":"bibliography","#text":"Includes bibliographical references and index."}],"subject":[{"geographicCode":{"@authority":"marcgac","#text":"a-ja---"}},{"@authority":"fast","temporal":"2000-2099"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":["Disaster relief","History"],"geographic":"Japan","temporal":"21st century"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":"Tohoku Earthquake and Tsunami, Japan, 2011"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":"Fukushima Nuclear Disaster, Japan, 2011"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":["Japan","Social conditions"],"temporal":"21st century"},{"@authority":"fast","topic":"Disaster relief"},{"@authority":"ram","topic":"Catastrophe nucléaire de Fukushima (2011)"},{"@authority":"ram","topic":"Séisme et tsunami du Tōhoku (2011)"},{"@authority":"ram","topic":"Secours aux victimes de catastrophes","geographic":"Japon"},{"@authority":"ram","topic":"Conditions sociales","geographic":"Japon","temporal":"1989-"},{"@authority":"fast","geographic":"Japan"},{"@authority":"fast","geographic":["Japan","Tōhoku Region"]}],"classification":[{"@authority":"lcc","#text":"HV555.J3 K65 2020"},{"@edition":"23","@authority":"ddc","#text":"952.05/12"}],"relatedItem":[{"titleInfo":{"title":"SOAS studies in modern and contemporary Japan"}},{"@type":"otherFormat","@displayLabel":"Online version:","@otherType":"Online version:","titleInfo":{"title":"Gender, culture, and disaster in post-3.11 Japan"},"name":{"namePart":"Koikari, Mire."},"originInfo":{"publisher":"London, UK ; New York, NY : Bloomsbury Academic, 2020."},"identifier":{"@type":"local","#text":"(DLC)  2020025153"}},{"@type":"series","titleInfo":{"title":"SOAS studies in modern and contemporary Japan"}},{"@otherType":"HOLLIS record","location":{"url":"https://id.lib.harvard.edu/alma/99155991561103941/catalog"}}],"identifier":[{"@type":"isbn","#text":"9781350122499"},{"@type":"isbn","#text":"1350122491"},{"@type":"isbn","@invalid":"yes","#text":"9781350122505"},{"@type":"isbn","@invalid":"yes","#text":"9781350122512"},{"@type":"lccn","#text":"2020025152"},{"@type":"oclc","#text":"1128099877"}],"location":[{"physicalLocation":{"@valueURI":"http://id.loc.gov/rwo/agents/no2014094889","@displayLabel":"Harvard repository","@type":"repository","#text":"Widener Library, Harvard University"},"shelfLocator":"HV555.J3 K65 2020"},null,null],"extension":[{"librarycloud":{"HarvardRepositories":{"HarvardRepository":"Widener"},"originalDocument":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/harvard.librarycloud.marc/99155991561103941","processingDate":"2022-04-28T08:19Z"}},{"sets":null}],"recordInfo":{"descriptionStandard":"rda","recordContentSource":{"@authority":"marcorg","#text":"DLC"},"recordCreationDate":{"@encoding":"marc","#text":"200616"},"recordChangeDate":{"@encoding":"iso8601","#text":"20220424"},"recordIdentifier":{"@source":"MH:ALMA","#text":"99155991561103941"},"recordOrigin":"Converted from MARCXML to MODS version 3.6 using MARC21slim2MODS3-6.xsl\n        (Revision 1.117 2017/02/14)","languageOfCataloging":{"languageTerm":{"@authority":"iso639-2b","@type":"code","#text":"eng"}}}},{"titleInfo":{"title":"Imperial Genus","subTitle":"The Formation and Limits of the Human in Modern Korea and Japan"},"name":{"@type":"personal","namePart":["Workman, Travis",{"@type":"date","#text":"1979-"}],"role":[{"roleTerm":{"@type":"text","#text":"creator"}},{"roleTerm":{"@type":"text","#text":"author."}}]},"typeOfResource":"text","genre":[{"@authority":"rdacontent","#text":"text"},{"@authority":"4","#text":"Electronic books.

In examining the techniques and impacts of whaling during the Tokugawa period (1603-1868), Jakobina Arch shows that the organized, shore-based whaling that first developed during these years bore little resemblance to modern Japanese whaling. Drawing on a wide range of sources, from whaling ledgers to recipe books and gravestones for fetal whales, she traces how the images of whales and byproducts of commercial whaling were woven into the lives of people throughout Japan. Economically, Pacific Ocean resources were central in supporting the expanding Tokugawa state.   In this vivid and nuanced study of how the Japanese people brought whales ashore during the Tokugawa period, Arch makes important contributions to both environmental and Japanese history by connecting Japanese whaling to marine environmental history in the Pacific, including the devastating impact of American whaling in the nineteenth century.\"--"},"tableOfContents":"Foreword : The aquamarine archipelago / by Paul S.

He illuminates the ways in which the imperial center and its individual colonies understood the concept of the Sphere, offering two sometimes competing, sometimes complementary, and always intertwined visions—one from Japan, the other from Burma and the Philippines.Yellen argues that, from 1940 to 1945, the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere epitomized two concurrent wars for Asia's future: the first was for a new type of empire in Asia, and the second was a political war, waged by nationalist elites in the colonial capitals of Rangoon and Manila. Exploring Japanese visions for international order in the face of an ever-changing geopolitical situation, The Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere explores wartime Japan's desire to shape and control its imperial future while its colonies attempted to do the same. At Japan's zenith as an imperial power, the Sphere represented a plan for regional domination; by the end of the war, it had been recast as the epitome of cooperative internationalism. In the end, the Sphere could not survive wartime defeat, and Yellen's lucidly written account reveals much about the desires of Japan as an imperial and colonial power, as well as the ways in which the subdued colonies in Burma and the Philippines jockeyed for agency and a say in the future of the region."},"tableOfContents":"Frontmatter --  Contents --  Acknowledgments --  A Note on Names, Transliterations, and Translations --  Introduction.

This volume marks a turning point in the study of early Japanese culture and will be indispensable for future explorations of the era.\" -Andrew Edmund Goble, University of Oregon\"As a Japanese historian, I enthusiastically recommend Heian Japan, Centers and Peripheries, the first multi-author English-language academic work to offer a synthetic treatment of the Heian period. Japan's emperor system is the last remaining sovereignty of its kind in human history, and this volume is indispensable when considering what sovereignty itself means in the present. To that end, the classical patterns established in the Heian period are superbly analyzed in this volume through the dual approach of 'centers and peripheries.'\" -Hotate Michihisa, Historiographical Institute, University of TokyoThe first three centuries of the Heian period (794-1086) saw some of its most fertile innovations and epochal achievements in Japanese literature and the arts. It was also a time of important transitions in the spheres of religion and politics, as aristocratic authority was consolidated in Kyoto, powerful court factions and religious institutions emerged, and adjustments were made in the Chinese-style system of ruler-ship. At the same time, the era's leaders faced serious challenges from the provinces that called into question the primacy and efficiency of the governmental system and tested the social/cultural status quo. Heian Japan, Centers and Peripheries, the first book of its kind to examine the early Heian from a wide variety of multidisciplinary perspectives, offers a fresh look at these seemingly contradictory trends.Essays by fourteen leading American, European, and Japanese scholars of art history, history, literature, and religions take up core texts and iconic images, cultural achievements and social crises, and the ever-fascinating patterns and puzzles of the time. The authors tackle some of Heian Japan's most enduring paradigms as well as hitherto unexplored problems in search of new ways of understanding the currents of change as well as the processes of institutionalization that shaped the Heian scene, defined the contours of its legacies, and make it one of the most intensely studied periods of the Japanese past.Contributors: Ryûichi Abé, Mikael Adolphson, Bruce Batten, Robert Borgen, Wayne Farris, Karl Friday, G.

Addressing how the Ministry of Justice in Japan justified capital punishment policy during the de facto moratorium periods from 1989 to 1993, from 2009 to 2010 and from 2010 to 2012, the author debates the misconceptions surrounding the significance of these moratoriums. The book evidences the approach, rationale and evolution of Japan’s Ministry of Justice in consistently justifying capital punishment policy during the different execution-free periods and provides a better understanding of the powerful unelected elite who actually drive the capital punishment system in Japan. Based on parliamentary proceedings, public opinion surveys and periodical reports by both international and domestic human rights NGOs as well as interviews of government ministers, NGO staff, pro- and anti-death-penalty advocates, this text is key reading for those interested in Japan, its government, criminal justice system and policies on the death penalty and human rights."},"tableOfContents":"Introduction -- The Two Sided Triangle: Capital Punishment Policy Decision Making - A Framework for Analysis -- Governmental Justification for Capital Punishment and the de facto Moratorium Periods Reconsidered -- An Honourable Death?: Governmental Justification for Capital Punishment from 1980 to 1989 -- Conscience or Chaos?: Governmental Justification for Capital Punishment during the de facto Moratorium Period (1989 to 1993) -- By Popular Demand: Governmental Justification for Capital Punishment from 1993 to 2009 -- Democracy Inaction: Governmental Justification for Capital Punishment during the de facto Moratorium Periods (2009 to 2010 and 2010 to 2012) -- Conclusions: New Light in Old Rooms - Governmental Justification for Capital Punishment in Japan Reconsidered.","note":[{"@type":"statement of responsibility","#text":"by Mika Obara-Minnitt."},{"@type":"bibliography","#text":"Includes bibliographical references and index."}],"subject":[{"geographicCode":{"@authority":"marcgac","#text":"a-ja---"}},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":"Corrections"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":"Punishment"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":"Asia—Politics and government"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":"Japan—History"},{"topic":"Prison and Punishment"},{"topic":"Asian Politics"},{"topic":"History of Japan"}],"classification":[{"@authority":"lcc","#text":"HV8301-HV9920.7"},{"@edition":"23","@authority":"ddc","#text":"345.520772"}],"relatedItem":[null,{"@otherType":"HOLLIS record","location":{"url":"https://id.lib.harvard.edu/alma/99153650270603941/catalog"}}],"identifier":[{"@type":"isbn","#text":"1-137-55822-9"},{"@type":"doi","#text":"10.1057/978-1-137-55822-0"}],"location":[null,null],"extension":[{"librarycloud":{"originalDocument":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/harvard.librarycloud.marc/99153650270603941","processingDate":"2022-06-15T05:13Z"}},{"sets":null}],"recordInfo":{"recordCreationDate":{"@encoding":"marc","#text":"161010"},"recordChangeDate":{"@encoding":"iso8601","#text":"20200630"},"recordIdentifier":{"@source":"MH:ALMA","#text":"99153650270603941"},"recordOrigin":"Converted from MARCXML to MODS version 3.6 using MARC21slim2MODS3-6.xsl\n        (Revision 1.117 2017/02/14)"}},{"titleInfo":{"title":"Earthquake record of Okuma","subTitle":"from the town where Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station is located"},"name":[{"@type":"corporate","@altRepGroup":"01","namePart":"Ōkuma-machi (Fukushima-ken, Japan)","role":{"roleTerm":{"@type":"text","#text":"publisher."}}},{"@type":"corporate","@altRepGroup":"01","namePart":"大熊町 (Fukushima-ken, Japan)","role":{"roleTerm":{"@type":"text","#text":"publisher."}}}],"typeOfResource":"text","genre":[{"@authority":"rdacontent","#text":"text"},{"@authority":"rdacontent","#text":"still image"},{"@authority":"fast","#text":"History"},{"@authority":"fast","#text":"Personal narratives"},{"@authority":"fast","#text":"Pictorial works"},{"@authority":"lcgft","#text":"Personal narratives"}],"originInfo":[{"place":{"placeTerm":[{"@authority":"marccountry","@type":"code","#text":"ja"},{"@authority":"marccountry","@type":"text","#text":"Japan"}]},"dateIssued":{"@encoding":"marc","#text":"2017"},"edition":"Summary version.","issuance":"monographic"},{"place":{"placeTerm":{"@type":"text","#text":"Aizuwakamatsu-shi, Fukushima, Japan:"}},"publisher":"Okuma Town,","dateIssued":"March 2017."}],"language":{"languageTerm":[{"@authority":"iso639-2b","@type":"code","#text":"eng"},{"@authority":"iso639-2b","@type":"text","#text":"English"}]},"physicalDescription":{"form":[{"@authority":"marcform","#text":"print"},{"@type":"media","@authority":"rdamedia","#text":"unmediated"},{"@type":"carrier","@authority":"rdacarrier","#text":"volume"}],"extent":"61 pages : color illustrations, color portraits ;

It takes a particular focus on the highly public start of the mixed court, the saiban-in system, and the jury system between 1928-1943. This was the first time Japanese citizens participated as decision makers in criminal law. The book assesses reasons for the jury system's failure, and its suspension in 1943, as well as the renewed interest in popular involvement in criminal justice at the end of the twentieth century. Popular Participation in Japanese Criminal Justice proceeds by explaining the process by which lay participation in criminal trials left the periphery to become an important national matter at the turn of the century. It shows that rather than an Anglo-American jury model, outline recommendations made by the Japanese Judicial Reform Council were for a mixed court of judges and laypersons to try serious cases. Concerns about the lay judge/saiban-in system are raised, as well as explanations for why it is flourishing in contemporary society despite the failure of the jury system during the period 1928-1943. The book presents the wider significance of Japanese mixed courts in Asia and beyond, and in doing so will be of great interests to scholars of socio-legal studies, criminology and criminal justice."},"tableOfContents":"Introduction -- Chapter 1.

The birds’ plumage was of high quality and sold at quite a good price in Europe. The Japanese realized the advantage of this global trade, and their desire to capture albatross motivated them to advance into the Pacific. The exploration of the uninhabited islands had become a fast-moving trend, defined by the author as the “Bird Rush”. As a consequence, the advance into the Pacific by the Japanese resulted in the expansion of Japanese territory. The author has interpreted this Japanese movement into the Pacific by making use of the framework of three distinct shifts: in the aim of their actions from birds to guano / phosphate ore, in the agents of action from individual speculators to commercial capital and then to monopolistic capital, and from the sea near Japan to the wider Pacific. This concept can be termed “a view of history centered on the albatross”."},"tableOfContents":"The Albatross and the Territorial Expansion of the Japanese Empire -- From the Decrease of Bird Resources to the Advance into Uninhabited Islands -- The \"Bird Rush\" and Japanese Advance into the Pacific Ocean -- From Advance into Islands in the South Sea to Invasion: From the Albatross to Guano/Phosphate Ore Mining -- Conclusions.","note":[{"@type":"statement of responsibility","#text":"by Akitoshi Hiraoka."},{"@type":"bibliography","#text":"Includes bibliographical references."}],"subject":[{"geographicCode":{"@authority":"marcgac","#text":"as-----"}},{"@authority":"fast","temporal":"1900-1999"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":"Physical geography"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":"Economic geography"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":"Japan—History"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":"Mineral resources"},{"topic":"World Regional Geography (Continents, Countries, Regions)"},{"topic":"Economic Geography"},{"topic":"History of Japan"},{"topic":"Mineral Resources"},{"@authority":"fast","geographic":"Japan"},{"@authority":"fast","geographic":"Southeast Asia"}],"classification":[{"@authority":"lcc","#text":"SF462.6 .H573 2018"},{"@edition":"23","@authority":"ddc","#text":"380.1438"}],"relatedItem":[{"titleInfo":{"title":"International Perspectives in Geography, AJG Library, 7"}},null,{"@type":"series","titleInfo":{"title":"International Perspectives in Geography, AJG Library, 7"}},{"@otherType":"HOLLIS record","location":{"url":"https://id.lib.harvard.edu/alma/99153676182503941/catalog"}}],"identifier":[{"@type":"isbn","#text":"981-10-5140-2"},{"@type":"doi","#text":"10.1007/978-981-10-5140-1"}],"location":[null,null],"extension":[{"librarycloud":{"originalDocument":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/harvard.librarycloud.marc/99153676182503941","processingDate":"2022-07-14T05:16Z"}},{"sets":null}],"recordInfo":{"descriptionStandard":"rda","recordContentSource":{"@authority":"marcorg","#text":"MiAaPQ"},"recordCreationDate":{"@encoding":"marc","#text":"170912"},"recordChangeDate":{"@encoding":"iso8601","#text":"20200705"},"recordIdentifier":{"@source":"MH:ALMA","#text":"99153676182503941"},"recordOrigin":"Converted from MARCXML to MODS version 3.6 using MARC21slim2MODS3-6.xsl\n        (Revision 1.117 2017/02/14)","languageOfCataloging":{"languageTerm":{"@authority":"iso639-2b","@type":"code","#text":"eng"}}}},{"titleInfo":[{"nonSort":"The  ","title":"Earth writes","subTitle":"the Great Earthquake and the novel in post-3/11 Japan"},{"@type":"alternative","title":"Great Earthquake and the novel in post March 11 Japan"}],"name":{"@type":"personal","namePart":["Haga, Kōichi",{"@type":"date","#text":"1970-"}],"role":[{"roleTerm":{"@type":"text","#text":"creator"}},{"roleTerm":{"@type":"text","#text":"author."}}]},"typeOfResource":"text","genre":[{"@authority":"marcgt","#text":"bibliography"},{"@authority":"rdacontent","#text":"text"},{"@authority":"fast","#text":"Criticism, interpretation, etc."}],"originInfo":[{"place":{"placeTerm":[{"@authority":"marccountry","@type":"code","#text":"mdu"},{"@authority":"marccountry","@type":"text","#text":"Maryland"}]},"dateIssued":{"@encoding":"marc","#text":"2019"},"issuance":"monographic"},{"place":{"placeTerm":{"@type":"text","#text":"Lanham, Maryland :"}},"publisher":"Lexington Books, an imprint of the Rowman & Littlefield Publishing Group, Inc.,","dateIssued":[2019]}],"language":{"languageTerm":[{"@authority":"iso639-2b","@type":"code","#text":"eng"},{"@authority":"iso639-2b","@type":"text","#text":"English"}]},"physicalDescription":{"form":[{"@authority":"marcform","#text":"print"},{"@type":"media","@authority":"rdamedia","#text":"unmediated"},{"@type":"carrier","@authority":"rdacarrier","#text":"volume"}],"extent":"xviii, 129 pages ; 24 cm."},"abstract":[{"@type":"Summary","#text":"\"This book explores how the tremendous earthquake on March 11, 2011 impacted literary authors in Japan and generated issues and perspectives previously unrecognized in Japanese literary and social culture.

Bui and Farrington however found that there is a higher level of violence among young Japanese males compared to that among young American males. The authors use psychological criminology to investigate this claim and present what is known about crime and antisocial behaviour in Japan from a psychological perspective (e.g. mental disorders, brain dysfunction, and family criminality) and explain how this fits into the broader understanding of crime at the individual level. This original project is the most up-to-date work on crime in Japan and progresses the important, and underdeveloped, field of criminal psychology. ."},"tableOfContents":"1. Introduction -- 2.

This book tells the story of the JAXA astronauts who have visited the International Space Station and how they have lived on board, helped construct the space laboratory and performed valuable scientific experiments. JAXA has contributed the largest single module to the ISS: the Kibō (Hope) science laboratory with its Logistics Module, Exposed Facility and robot arm. JAXA supplies the station with cargo and supplies on its automated cargo spacecraft, the H-II Transfer Vehicle (HTV), but it is the human endeavour that captures the imagination. From brief visits to six-month expeditions, from spacewalking to commanding the Earth’s only outpost in space, JAXA astronauts have played a vital role in the international project. Extensive use of colour photographs from NASA and JAXA depicting the experiments carried out and the phases of the ISS construction, together with the personal stories of the astronauts’ experiences in space, highlight the crucial part the Japanese have played in human spaceflight."},"tableOfContents":"Foreword -- Preface -- Acknowledgements -- About the author -- Acronyms -- Part 1: Background -- Chapter 1:Before ISS -- Chapter 2: Spacecraft -- Part 2: Missions -- Chapter 3: STS-92 -- Chapter 4: STS-114 -- Chapter 5: STS-123 -- Chapter 6: STS-124 -- Chapter 7: STS-119, Expeditions 18, 19 and 20, STS-127 -- Chapter 8: Soyuz TMA-17, Expeditions 22 and 23 -- Chapter 9: STS-131 -- Chapter 10: Soyuz TMA-02M, Expeditions 28 and 29 -- Chapter 11: Soyuz TMA-05M, Expeditions 32 and 33 -- Chapter 12: Soyuz TMA-11M, Expeditions 38 and 39 -- Chapter 13: Soyuz TMA-17M, Expeditions 44 and 45 -- Chapter 14: Soyuz MS-01, Expeditions 48 and 49 -- Chapter 15: Soyuz MS-07, Expeditions 54 and 55 -- The Future -- Bibliography -- Image links -- Appendix: Japanese Missions to the ISS -- Index.","note":{"@type":"statement of responsibility","#text":"by John O'Sullivan."},"subject":[{"geographicCode":{"@authority":"marcgac","#text":"a-ja---"}},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":"Technology"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":"Aerospace engineering"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":"Astronautics"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":"Space sciences"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":"Japan—History"},{"topic":"Popular Science in Technology"},{"topic":"Aerospace Technology and Astronautics"},{"topic":"Space Sciences (including Extraterrestrial Physics, Space Exploration and Astronautics)"},{"topic":"History of Japan"}],"classification":[{"@authority":"lcc","#text":"T-TX"},{"@edition":"23","@authority":"ddc","#text":"629.40952"}],"relatedItem":[{"titleInfo":{"title":"Space Exploration"}},null,{"@type":"series","titleInfo":{"title":"Space Exploration"}},{"@otherType":"HOLLIS record","location":{"url":"https://id.lib.harvard.edu/alma/99153819316603941/catalog"}}],"identifier":[{"@type":"isbn","#text":"3-030-04534-X"},{"@type":"doi","#text":"10.1007/978-3-030-04534-0"}],"location":[null,null],"extension":[{"librarycloud":{"originalDocument":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/harvard.librarycloud.marc/99153819316603941","processingDate":"2022-06-12T05:13Z"}},{"sets":null}],"recordInfo":{"recordCreationDate":{"@encoding":"marc","#text":"190323"},"recordChangeDate":{"@encoding":"iso8601","#text":"20200704"},"recordIdentifier":{"@source":"MH:ALMA","#text":"99153819316603941"},"recordOrigin":"Converted from MARCXML to MODS version 3.6 using MARC21slim2MODS3-6.xsl\n        (Revision 1.117 2017/02/14)"}},{"titleInfo":{"nonSort":"The  ","title":"United States and the Far Eastern Crisis of 1933-1938","subTitle":"From the Manchurian Incident through the Initial Stage of the Undeclared Sino-Japanese War"},"name":{"@type":"personal","namePart":"Borg, Dorothy","role":[{"roleTerm":{"@type":"text","#text":"creator"}},{"roleTerm":{"@type":"text","#text":"author."}}]},"typeOfResource":"text","genre":[{"@authority":"marcgt","#text":"dictionary"},{"@authority":"marcgt","#text":"government publication"},{"@authority":"rdacontent","#text":"text"}],"originInfo":[{"place":[{"placeTerm":[{"@authority":"marccountry","@type":"code","#text":"mau"},{"@authority":"marccountry","@type":"text","#text":"Massachusetts"}]},{"placeTerm":{"@authority":"iso3166","@type":"code","#text":"US-MA"}}],"dateIssued":{"@encoding":"marc","#text":"2014"},"edition":"Reprint 2013","issuance":"monographic"},{"place":{"placeTerm":{"@type":"text","#text":"Cambridge, MA : "}},"publisher":"Harvard University Press, ","dateIssued":[2014]}],"language":{"languageTerm":[{"@authority":"iso639-2b","@type":"code","#text":"eng"},{"@authority":"iso639-2b","@type":"text","#text":"English"}]},"physicalDescription":{"form":[{"@authority":"marccategory","#text":"electronic resource"},{"@authority":"marcsmd","#text":"remote"},{"@type":"media","@authority":"rdamedia","#text":"computer"},{"@type":"carrier","@authority":"rdacarrier","#text":"online resource"}],"extent":"1 online resource (684 p.)"},"tableOfContents":" Frontmatter --  PREFACE --  CONTENTS --  CHAPTER I.

The book also includes interviews with victims that explore the social implications of radioactive contamination and invite comparisons to the discrimination faced by survivors of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings.

It may seem difficult to think of Japanese Buddhism as being linked to the realm of medical practices since religious healing is usually thought to be restricted to prayers for divine intervention. There is a surprising lack of scholarship regarding medicinal practices in Japanese Buddhism although an overwhelming amount of primary sources proves otherwise. A careful re-reading of well-known materials from a study-of-religions perspective, together with in some cases a first-time exploration of manuscripts and prints, opens new views on an understudied field. The book presents a topical survey and comprises chapters on treating sight-related diseases, women’s health, plant-based materica medica and medicinal gardens, and finally horse medicine to include veterinary knowledge. Terminological problems faced in working on this material – such as ‘religious’ or ‘magical healing’ as opposed to ‘secular medicine’ – are assessed. The book suggests focusing more on the plural nature of the Japanese healing system as encountered in the primary sources and reconsidering the use of categories from the European intellectual tradition."},"tableOfContents":"Frontmatter --  Contents --  Prologue --  Acknowledgements --  Conventions --  Introduction --  1.

Hitler offers a deeply learned and radically revisionist biography, arguing that the dictator's main strategic enemy, from the start of his political career in the 1920s, was not communism or the Soviet Union, but capitalism and the United States. Whereas most historians have argued that Hitler underestimated the American threat, Simms shows that Hitler embarked on a preemptive war with the United States precisely because he considered it such a potent adversary. The war against the Jews was driven both by his anxiety about combatting the supposed forces of international plutocracy and by a broader desire to maintain the domestic cohesion he thought necessary for survival on the international scene. A powerfully argued and utterly definitive account of a murderous tyrant we thought we understood, Hitler is essential reading for anyone seeking to understand the origins and outcomes of the Second World War.\" -- Publisher's website"},"tableOfContents":"Introduction -- Humiliation.

scientists are made, examining such questions as the extent to which scientific pedagogy shapes research and how pedagogical regimes interact with wider societies. In light of today's global and transnational society, it is necessary, even pressing, to add a fourth dimension to this research agenda: cross-national exchange of ideas, people, and materials for the construction of a pedagogical regime. Japan in the Meiji period makes an ideal case for this inquiry. A nascent nation-state which tried to build a Western-style higher education system as part of its industrialization policy, Japan desperately needed models for institution-building for survival in an increasingly Euro- and American-centric world order. It first looked to Great Britain as a model for a strong industrial power, and the United States as a model for a young, fast growing country that was vigorously building administrative, educational, and industrial institutions. British and American teachers were dominant in Japanese higher education between the 1860s and 1880s, and many Japanese overseas students went to British and American universities and colleges to finish their training during this period. Increase of German presence in Japanese higher education (and in politics and administration) came later, from the 1880s onward. As a result, Meiji Japan became, so to speak, a kaleidoscope of Western (as well as Japanese) styles in many aspects of institutional as well as material culture\"--"},"tableOfContents":"Machine generated contents note: -- 1.

In this pathbreaking account, Duncan Ryūken Williams reveals how, even as they were stripped of their homes and imprisoned in camps, Japanese-American Buddhists launched one of the most inspiring defenses of religious freedom in our nation's history, insisting that they could be both Buddhist and American. Nearly all Americans of Japanese descent were subject to bigotry and accusations of disloyalty, but Buddhists aroused particular suspicion. Government officials, from the White House to small-town mayors, believed that Buddhism was incompatible with American values. Intelligence agencies targeted the Buddhist community for surveillance, and Buddhist priests were deemed a threat to national security. On December 7, 1941, as the bombs fell on Pearl Harbor, Attorney General Francis Biddle issued a warrant to \"take into custody all Japanese\" classified as potential national security threats. The first person detained was Bishop Gikyō Kuchiba, leader of the Nishi Hongwanji Buddhist sect in Hawai`i. In the face of discrimination, dislocation, dispossession, and confinement, Japanese Americans turned to their faith to sustain them, whether they were behind barbed wire in camps or serving in one of the most decorated combat units in the European theater. Using newly translated sources and extensive interviews with survivors of the camps and veterans of the war, American Sutra reveals how the Japanese American community broadened our country's conception of religious freedom and forged a new American Buddhism.\"--Dust jacket."},"tableOfContents":"Prologue: Thus have I heard: an American sutra.

This happened despite the Tokugawa shogunate’s successful efforts to criminalize Christianity and even after the Meiji government took measures to limit its influence (after decriminalizing it out of diplomatic necessity). From journalism and literature, to medicine, education, and politics, the mark of Protestant Japanese is indelible. Herein lies the conundrum that has interested scholars for decades. How did Christianity overcome the ideological legacies of its past in Japan? How did Protestantism distinguish itself from the other options in the religious landscape like Buddhism and New Religions? And how did the religious movement’s social relevance and activism persist despite the new government’s measures to weaken the relationship between private religion and secular social life in Japan?In Church Space and the Capital in Prewar Japan, Garrett Washington responds to these questions with a spatially explicit study on the influence of the Protestant church in imperial Japan. He examines the physical and social spaces that Tokyo’s largest Japanese-led Protestant congregations cultivated between 1879 and 1923 and their broader social ties. These churches developed alongside, and competed with, the locational, architectural, and social spaces of Buddhism, Shinto, and Japanese New Religions. Their success depended on their pastors’ decisions about location and relocation, those men’s conceptualizations of the new imperial capital and aspirations for Japan, and the Western-style buildings they commissioned. Japanese pastors and laypersons grappled with Christianity’s relationships to national identity, political ideology, women’s rights, Japanese imperialism, and modernity; church-based group activities aimed to raise social awareness and improve society. Further, it was largely through attendees’ externalized ideals, experiences, and networks developed at church but expressed in their public lives outside the church that Protestant Christianity exerted such a visible, surprising influence on modern Japanese society. This groundbreaking history offers answers to longstanding questions about Protestant Christianity’s reputation and impact, but also goes further. It importantly uses a new space-centered perspective to focus attention on Japanese agency in the religion’s metamorphosis and social impact, adding a fresh narrative of cultural imperialism."},"tableOfContents":"Frontmatter --  Contents --  Illustrations --  Acknowledgments --  (Re)Introducing Christianity in Modern Japan --  Chapter One.

E. Taylor Atkins shows how Japan is one of the earliest sites for the development of mass-produced, market-oriented cultural products consumed by urban middle and working classes. The best-known traditional arts and culture of Japan--Noh theater, monochrome ink painting, court literature, poetry and indigenous music--inhabited a world distinct from that of urban commoners, who fashioned their own expressive forms and laid the groundwork for today's 'gross national cool.' Popular culture was pivotal in the rise of Japanese nationalism, imperialism, militarism, postwar democracy, and economic development. Eschewing a chronological narrative to instead offer historiographical and analytical frameworks for understanding its subject, A History of Popular Culture in Japan synthesizes the latest scholarship from a variety of disciplines. It is a vital resource for students of Japanese cultural history wishing to gain a deeper understanding of Japan's contributions to global cultural heritage, and a nuanced view of how popular culture provides a space for Japanese to understand themselves and their place in the world\"--Provided by publisher."}],"tableOfContents":"1.

Visit www.luminosoa.org to learn more. Scholarly discussions on economic development in history, specifically those linked to industrialization or modern economic growth, have paid great attention to the formation and development of the market economy as a set of institutions able to augment people's welfare. The role of specific nonmarket practices for promoting the economic development and welfare has been a distinct concern, typically involving discussion of the state's economic policies. How have societies tackled those issues that the market did not? To what extent did those solutions reflect the structure of an economy? Public Goods Provision in the Early Modern Economy explores these questions by investigating efforts made for the provision of \";public goods\"; in early modern economies from the perspective of Japanese socioeconomic history during Tokugawa era (1603-1868), and by comparing those cases with others from Europe and China's economic history. The contributors focus on three areas of inquiry-early modern era welfare policies for the poor, infrastructure, and forest management-to provide both a unique perspective on Japanese public finance at local levels and a vantage point outside of Europe to encourage a more global view of early modern political economies that shaped subsequent modern transformations.

In the richly illustrated Seeking Śākyamuni, Richard M. Jaffe reveals the experiences of the first Japanese Buddhists who traveled to South Asia in search of Buddhist knowledge beginning in 1873. Analyzing the impact of these voyages on Japanese conceptions of Buddhism, he argues that South Asia developed into a pivotal nexus for the development of twentieth-century Japanese Buddhism. Jaffe shows that Japan's growing economic ties to the subcontinent following World War I fostered even more Japanese pilgrimage and study at Buddhism's foundational sites. Tracking the Japanese travelers who returned home, as well as South Asians who visited Japan, Jaffe describes how the resulting flows of knowledge, personal connections, linguistic expertise, and material artifacts of South and Southeast Asian Buddhism instantiated the growing popular consciousness of Buddhism as a pan-Asian tradition-in the heart of Japan."},"tableOfContents":"Frontmatter -- Contents -- Acknowledgments -- Conventions --  Abbreviations -- Introduction: Locating Tenjiku --  1.

In the richly illustrated Seeking Śākyamuni, Richard M. Jaffe reveals the experiences of the first Japanese Buddhists who traveled to South Asia in search of Buddhist knowledge beginning in 1873. Analyzing the impact of these voyages on Japanese conceptions of Buddhism, he argues that South Asia developed into a pivotal nexus for the development of twentieth-century Japanese Buddhism. Jaffe shows that Japan’s growing economic ties to the subcontinent following World War I fostered even more Japanese pilgrimage and study at Buddhism’s foundational sites. Tracking the Japanese travelers who returned home, as well as South Asians who visited Japan, Jaffe describes how the resulting flows of knowledge, personal connections, linguistic expertise, and material artifacts of South and Southeast Asian Buddhism instantiated the growing popular consciousness of Buddhism as a pan-Asian tradition—in the heart of Japan."},"tableOfContents":"Frontmatter --  Contents --  Acknowledgments --  Conventions --  Abbreviations --  Introduction: Locating Tenjiku --  1.

With a state focused more on the emblematic goals of mechanization, urbanization, and a modern military, it fell upon local elites in villages across the country to bring rice production into the modern era. Middlemen of Modernity explores these elites and their actions in a region in northeastern Japan, presenting a view of the transformation of Japanese agriculture from the late nineteenth century to the mid-twentieth century. Meiji-era agricultural policy called for village elites to mobilize their wealth and local reputations to introduce improved farming methods, transform the physical landscape, and increase agricultural production. Farmers looked to the same figures to use their elevated status and government connections to direct public funds toward building prosperous villages. But economic shocks and social change created a new generation of elites with their own vision for agricultural improvement, leading to conditions that caused famine, economic disparity, and village unrest. The official and local responses to these discrepancies brought an end to the elite leadership of agricultural development at the beginning of the twentieth century, but its legacy set the course for farming and rural Japanese society for the next half century.Middlemen of Modernity offers a new perspective on Japanese modernization, one in which farming villages were neither premodern relics nor secondary concerns for the architects of the new nation. Modernity was worked out in the mud of rice paddies, as much as in any stateroom or factory, and the communities of Miyagi and villages throughout Japan helped shape the modern state, even as they were shaped by it. Mining a wealth of local sources, Christopher Craig provides a comprehensive study studded with stories of individual actors that remains closely connected to Japan's development and presents a history of agriculture from the early Meiji period to the postwar American occupation. Craig also engages with scholarship in environmental history and food studies, and his detailed treatment of the interactions between local villagers and central bureaucrats makes a valuable contribution to studies of state-society relations."},"tableOfContents":"Frontmatter --  Contents --  Acknowledgments --  Introduction --  Chapter One Mayor Straw Sandals: Kamata Sannosuke and the

He looks at Japanese modernism from the mid-19th century 'opening to the West' until the 21st-century, globalized world of 'postmodernism'; from the early Meiji 'cult of modernity' to the early Showa attempt to 'overcome modernity'. In this way, the book presents the history of Japanese modernism not as a straightforward, linear narrative of progressive acceptance and adaptation but more as a dialectical, back-and-forth oscillation between the two poles of acceptance and rejection, modernism and anti-modernism. Furthermore, Starrs shows that Japanese modernism was not simply the outcome of the passive reception of a unidirectional modern Western influence but of a complex cross-cultural interchange between East and West, modernity and tradition. In particular, he shows that traditional Japanese culture was very much part of that cultural mix, and a prime source of inspiration for modernists in both Japan and the West. Thus the book also convincingly demonstrates that Japan served as an active agent at certain key moments in the history of world modernism\"--"},"tableOfContents":"Introduction: modernity and modernism in a Japanese context -- Part I, Constructing 'Modernity' and 'Tradition': Modernism and Anti-Modernism in Meiji Japan, 1868-1912: Constructing Meiji modernity; The anti-modernist backlash: constructing Meiji tradition; The novel as modernist medium: modernity and anti-modernity in Meiji fiction -- Part II.

the World War II story of two men whose remarkable lives improbably converged at the Tokyo war crimes trials of 1946. In the wake of World War II, the Allied forces charged twenty-eight Japanese men with crimes against humanity. Correspondents at the Tokyo trial thought the evidence fell most heavily on ten of the accused. In December 1948, five of these defendants were hanged while four received sentences of life in prison. The tenth was a brilliant philosopher-patriot named Okawa Shumei. His story proved strangest of all. Among all the political and military leaders on trial, Okawa was the lone civilian. In the years leading up to World War II, he had outlined a divine mission for Japan to lead Asia against the West, prophesized a great clash with the United States, planned coups d'etat with military rebels, and financed the assassination of Japan's prime minister.^ Beyond 'all vestiges of doubt,' concluded a classified American intelligence report, 'Okawa moved in the best circles of nationalist intrigue.' Okawa's guilt as a conspirator appeared straightforward. But on the first day of the Tokyo trial, he made headlines around the world by slapping star defendant and wartime prime minister Tojo Hideki on the head. Had Okawa lost his sanity? Or was he faking madness to avoid a grim punishment? A U.S. Army psychiatrist stationed in occupied Japan, Major Daniel Jaffe--the author's grandfather--was assigned to determine Okawa's ability to stand trial, and thus his fate. Jaffe was no stranger to madness. He had seen it his whole life: in his mother, as a boy in Brooklyn; in soldiers, on the battlefields of Europe. Now his seasoned eye faced the ultimate test. If Jaffe deemed Okawa sane, the war crimes suspect might be hanged.^ But if Jaffe found Okawa insane, the philosopher patriot might escape justice for his role in promoting Japan's wartime aggression. Meticulously researched, A Curious Madness is both expansive in scope and vivid in detail. As the story pushes both Jaffe and Okawa toward their postwar confrontation, it explores such diverse topics as the roots of belligerent Japanese nationalism, the development of combat psychiatry during World War II, and the complex nature of postwar justice. Eric Jaffe is at his best in this suspenseful and engrossing historical narrative of the fateful intertwining of two men on different sides of the war and the world and the question of insanity\"--"},"tableOfContents":"The Slap Heard Round the World -- A Young Philosopher-Patriot -- The House on Lyme Avenue -- Heavenly Mission -- Loose Ends -- Showa Restoration -- The Making of a

Japanese imperialism in Manchuria before 1931 developed in a manner similar to that of other imperialists elsewhere in China, but beginning in 1932 the Japanese sought to surpass their rivals by transforming the northeastern city of Changchun into a grand capital for the new client state of Manchukuo, putting it on the cutting edge of Japanese propaganda. Providing a thematic assessment of the evolving nature of planning, architecture, economy, and society in Changchun, Bill Sewell examines the key organizations involved in developing Japan?s empire there as part of larger efforts to assert its place in the world order.

Highlighting the role of the god Okuninushi and the mythology centered on the Izumo Shrine in western Japan as part of this process, he shows how and why this god came to be ignored in State Shinto in the modern period. In doing so, Zhong moves away from the traditional understanding of Shinto history as something completely internal to the nation of Japan, and instead situates the formation of Shinto within a larger geopolitical context involving intellectual and political developments in the East Asian region and the role of western colonial expansion. The Origin of Modern Shinto in Japan draws extensively on primary source materials in Japan, many of which were only made available to the public less than a decade ago and have not yet been studied. Source materials analysed include shrine records and object materials, contemporary written texts, official materials from the national and provincial levels, and a broad range of visual sources based on contemporary prints, drawings, photographs and material culture\"--"},"tableOfContents":"Machine generated contents note: -- List of Figures -- Acknowledgements -- Note on Text/Translation -- Introduction -- 1: Resurrecting the Great Lord of the Land -- 2: The Month without the Gods -- 3: True Pillar of the Soul -- 4: Converting Japan -- 5: Competing Ways of the Gods -- Conclusion -- Notes -- Bibliography.","note":[{"@type":"statement of responsibility","#text":"Yijiang Zhong."},"Outgrowth of the author's thesis (doctoral--University of Chicago, 2011) under the title: Gods without names : the genesis of modern Shinto in nineteenth century Japan.",{"@type":"bibliography","#text":"Includes bibliographical references and index."}],"subject":[{"geographicCode":{"@authority":"marcgac","#text":"a-ja---"}},{"@authority":"fast","temporal":"To 1868"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":["Shinto","History"],"temporal":"To 1868"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":"Ōkuninushi no kami"},{"@authority":"bisacsh","topic":["RELIGION","Shintoism"]},{"@authority":"bisacsh","topic":["HISTORY","Japan"],"geographic":"Asia"},{"@authority":"bisacsh","topic":["RELIGION","History"]},{"@authority":"bisacsh","topic":["RELIGION","Buddhism","History"]},{"@authority":"fast","topic":"Ōkuninushi no kami"},{"@authority":"fast","topic":"Religion"},{"@authority":"fast","topic":"Shinto"},{"@authority":"lcsh","geographic":"Japan","topic":"Religion","temporal":"1600-1868"},{"@authority":"fast","geographic":"Japan"}],"classification":[{"@authority":"lcc","#text":"BL2218.3 .Z49 2016"},{"@edition":"23","@authority":"ddc","#text":"299.5/6109"},{"@authority":"bisacsh","#text":"REL060000 HIS021000 REL033000 REL007010"}],"relatedItem":[{"titleInfo":{"title":"Bloomsbury Shinto studies"}},{"@type":"otherFormat","@displayLabel":"Online version:","@otherType":"Online version:","titleInfo":{"title":"Origin of modern Shinto in Japan"},"name":{"namePart":"Zhong, Yijiang, author."},"originInfo":{"publisher":"New York : Bloomsbury Academic, 2016"},"identifier":{"@type":"local","#text":"(DLC)^^2016024688"}},{"@otherType":"HOLLIS record","location":{"url":"https://id.lib.harvard.edu/alma/990148129760203941/catalog"}}],"identifier":[{"@type":"isbn","#text":"9781474271080"},{"@type":"isbn","#text":"1474271081"},{"@type":"lccn","#text":"^^2016016231"},{"@type":"oclc","#text":"920451369"}],"location":[{"physicalLocation":{"@valueURI":"http://id.loc.gov/rwo/agents/no2014094889","@displayLabel":"Harvard repository","@type":"repository","#text":"Widener Library, Harvard University"},"shelfLocator":"BL2218.3 .Z49 2016"},null,null],"extension":[{"librarycloud":{"HarvardRepositories":{"HarvardRepository":"Widener"},"originalDocument":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/harvard.librarycloud.marc/990148129760203941","priorrecordids":{"recordIdentifier":{"@source":"MH:ALEPH","#text":"014812976"}},"processingDate":"2022-07-31T03:22Z"}},{"sets":null}],"recordInfo":{"descriptionStandard":"rda","recordContentSource":{"@authority":"marcorg","#text":"DLC"},"recordCreationDate":{"@encoding":"marc","#text":"160429"},"recordChangeDate":{"@encoding":"iso8601","#text":"20161017"},"recordIdentifier":{"@source":"MH:ALMA","#text":"990148129760203941"},"recordOrigin":"Converted from MARCXML to MODS version 3.6 using MARC21slim2MODS3-6.xsl\n        (Revision 1.117 2017/02/14)","languageOfCataloging":{"languageTerm":{"@authority":"iso639-2b","@type":"code","#text":"eng"}}}},{"titleInfo":{"title":"Irradiated cities"},"name":{"@type":"personal","namePart":"Nagai, Mariko","role":[{"roleTerm":{"@type":"text","#text":"creator"}},{"roleTerm":{"@type":"text","#text":"author."}}]},"typeOfResource":"text","genre":[{"@authority":"marcgt","#text":"bibliography"},{"@authority":"marcgt","#text":"essay"},{"@authority":"rdacontent","#text":"text"},{"@authority":"fast","#text":"History"}],"originInfo":[{"place":{"placeTerm":[{"@authority":"marccountry","@type":"code","#text":"cau"},{"@authority":"marccountry","@type":"text","#text":"California"}]},"dateIssued":{"@encoding":"marc","#text":"2017"},"edition":"First edition.","issuance":"monographic"},{"place":{"placeTerm":{"@type":"text","#text":"Los Angeles, CA :"}},"publisher":"Les Figues Press,","dateIssued":"2017."}],"language":{"languageTerm":[{"@authority":"iso639-2b","@type":"code","#text":"eng"},{"@authority":"iso639-2b","@type":"text","#text":"English"}]},"physicalDescription":{"form":[{"@authority":"marcform","#text":"print"},{"@type":"media","@authority":"rdamedia","#text":"unmediated"},{"@type":"carrier","@authority":"rdacarrier","#text":"volume"}],"extent":"133 pages : illustrations ; 21 cm"},"tableOfContents":"Hiroshima : tu n'as rien vu à Hiroshima.

This was a means of describing their wealth and sophistication, their willingness to trade with the West, and their presumed capacity to become Christianized. But by the end of the seventeenth century the category of whiteness was reserved for Europeans only. When and how did Asians become \"yellow\" in the Western imagination? Looking at the history of racial thinking, Becoming Yellow explores the notion of yellowness and shows that this label originated not in early travel texts or objective descriptions, but in the eighteenth- and nineteenth-century scientific discourses on race. From the walls of an ancient Egyptian tomb, which depicted people of varying skin tones including yellow, to the phrase \"yellow peril\" at the beginning of the twentieth century in Europe and America, Michael Keevak follows the development of perceptions about race and human difference. He indicates that the conceptual relationship between East Asians and yellow skin did not begin in Chinese culture or Western readings of East Asian cultural symbols, but in anthropological and medical records that described variations in skin color. Eighteenth-century taxonomers such as Carl Linnaeus, as well as Victorian scientists and early anthropologists, assigned colors to all racial groups, and once East Asians were lumped with members of the Mongolian race, they began to be considered yellow. Demonstrating how a racial distinction took root in Europe and traveled internationally, Becoming Yellow weaves together multiple narratives to tell the complex history of a problematic term."},"tableOfContents":"Front matter -- Contents -- Illustrations -- Acknowledgments -- Introduction: No Longer White -- Chapter 1.

Despite persistent economic and social stresses, the country seemed to be approaching a new period of growth. The idea that the shogunate would not last forever was far from anyone's mind.Yet, in that year, an anonymous samurai author completed one of the most detailed critiques of Edo society known today. Writing as Buyo Inshi, \"a retired gentleman of Edo,\" he expresses a profound despair with the state of the realm and with people's behavior and attitudes. He sees decay wherever he turns and believes the world will soon descend into war.Buyo shows a familiarity with many corners of Edo life that one might not expect in a samurai. He describes the corruption of samurai officials; the suffering of the poor in villages and cities; the operation of brothels; the dealings of blind moneylenders; the selling and buying of temple abbotships; and the dubious strategies townspeople use in the law courts. Perhaps the frankness of his account, which contains a wealth of concrete information about Edo society, made him prefer to remain anonymous.This volume contains a full translation of Buyo's often-\"ed but rarely studied work by a team of specialists on Edo society. Together with extensive annotation of the translation, the volume includes an introduction that situates the text culturally and historically."},"tableOfContents":"Frontmatter --  Contents --  Preface --  Era Names, Measures, Currencies --  Maps --  Part 1.

Over time, they have altered their natural environment in numerous ways, from landscape modification to industrial pollution. How has the human-nature relationship changed over time in Japan? How does Japan's environmental history compare with that of other countries, or that of the world as a whole? Environment and Society in the Japanese Islands attempts to answer these questions through a series of case studies by leading Japanese and Western historians, geographers, archaeologists, and climatologists. These essays, on diverse topics from all periods of Japanese history and prehistory, are unified by their focus on the key concepts of 'resilience' and 'risk mitigation.' Taken as a whole, they place Japan's experience in global context and call into question the commonly presumed division between pre-modern and modern environmental history. Primarily intended for scholars and students in fields related to Japan or environmental history, these accessibly-written essays will be valuable to anyone wishing to learn about the historical roots of today's environmental issues or the complex relationship between human society and the natural environment\"--"},"tableOfContents":"Introduction: Green Perspectives on the Japanese Past / Bruce L.

The authors take the unique approach of locating gender history within a society's national history as well as describing its role in an integrated history of East Asia. In addition, this book examines the global context of historical changes in these countries and highlights cross-cultural themes that transcend national boundaries. For example, themes or concepts such as \"writing,\" \"the body,\" \"feminism,\" \"immigration and diasporas,\" and \"Confucianism\" are part of an integrated history. The authors capture the flow of ideas, people, materials, and texts throughout these three countries in an easily accessible way for students\"--"},"tableOfContents":"Gender in Ancient and Medieval

Murray's unwavering commitment to its success renders him an educational pioneer in Japan in the modern world. Benjamin Duke has compiled this comprehensive biography of David Murray to showcase Murray's work, both in assisting around 100 samurai students in their studies at Rutgers, and in his unprecedented role in early Japanese-American relations.

This study focuses on the company's clashes with Tokugawa Japan over diplomacy, violence, and sovereignty. In each encounter the Dutch were forced to retreat, compelled to abandon their claims to sovereign powers, and to refashion themselves again and again-from subjects of a fictive king to loyal vassals of the shogun, from aggressive pirates to meek merchants, and from insistent defenders of colonial sovereignty to legal subjects of the Tokugawa state. Within the confines of these conflicts, the terms of the relationship between the company and the shogun first took shape and were subsequently set into what would become their permanent form. The first book to treat the Dutch East India Company in Japan as something more than just a commercial organization, The Company and the Shogun presents new perspective on one of the most important, long-lasting relationships to develop between an Asian state and a European overseas enterprise."},"tableOfContents":"Front matter -- Contents -- Acknowledgments -- Archival sources -- Introduction: Taming the Dutch -- I.

Today, it is also one of the best prepared and resilient nations to face such sizeable seismic risk. This was not always the case. Earthquake Children is the first book to examine the origins of modern Japan's infrastructure of resilience. Drawing from a rich collection of previously unexplored sources, Janet Borland vividly illustrates that Japan's contemporary culture of disaster preparedness and its people's ability to respond calmly in a time of emergency are the result of learned and practiced behaviors. She traces their origins to the aftermath of the Great Kantō Earthquake, which killed over 100,000 people when it struck the Tokyo region in 1923. Beyond providing new perspectives on Japan's seismic past, the history of childhood, and everyday life in interwar Japan, this book challenges popular notions that Japanese people behave calmly whenever disaster strikes due to their innate qualities. Tokyo's traumatic experiences in 1923 convinced government officials, seismologists, teachers, physicians, and architects that Japan must better prepare for future disasters. Earthquake Children documents how children, schools, and education became primary tools through which experts sought to build a disaster-prepared society and resilient nation\"--"},"tableOfContents":"1 A City at Risk: Young and Vulnerable Tokyo p. 10 -- 2 Hell on Earth p. 40 -- 3 Objects of Sympathy and Specialized Care p. 77 -- 4 Objects of Investigation and Agents of Recovery p. 106 -- 5 Earthquake Teachers p. 136 -- 6 \"Wake Up, Japan!

illuminate the interrelationship of aesthetics, technology, and cultural modernity in prewar Japan. Putting the cinema at the center of a \"culture of the sound image\", it restores complexity to a media transition that is often described simply as slow and reluctant. In that vibrant sound culture, the talkie was introduced on the radio before it could be heard in the cinema, and pop music adaptations substituted for musicals even as cinema musicians and live narrators resisted the introduction of recorded sound. Taken together, the essays show that the development of sound technology shaped the economic structure of the film industry and its labour practices, the intermedial relation between cinema, radio, and popular music, as well as the architecture of cinemas and the visual style of individual Japanese films and filmmakers."},"tableOfContents":"Frontmatter --  Table of Contents --  Introduction --

Visit www.luminosoa.org to learn more. Scholarly discussions on economic development in history, specifically those linked to industrialization or modern economic growth, have paid great attention to the formation and development of the market economy as a set of institutions able to augment people's welfare. The role of specific nonmarket practices for promoting the economic development and welfare has been a distinct concern, typically involving discussion of the state's economic policies. How have societies tackled those issues that the market did not? To what extent did those solutions reflect the structure of an economy? Public Goods Provision in the Early Modern Economy explores these questions by investigating efforts made for the provision of \";public goods\"; in early modern economies from the perspective of Japanese socioeconomic history during Tokugawa era (1603-1868), and by comparing those cases with others from Europe and China's economic history. The contributors focus on three areas of inquiry-early modern era welfare policies for the poor, infrastructure, and forest management-to provide both a unique perspective on Japanese public finance at local levels and a vantage point outside of Europe to encourage a more global view of early modern political economies that shaped subsequent modern transformations."},"tableOfContents":"Frontmatter --  Contents --  List of Illustrations --  Preface --  1.

The state is undoubtedly the most important actor in the process of memory production and along with conservative legislators and the grass-root revisionist movement there has been a consistent failure to acknowledge responsibility for Japan's wartime past. However, to fully comprehend war memory in Japan, due attention must be paid to competing discourses that demand an alternative view, and only then can the true complexity of Japanese war memory and attitudes towards the legacies of the Asia-Pacific war be understood. The Politics of War Memory in Japan examines the involvement of five civil society actors in the struggle over remembering and addressing the wartime past in Japan today. In studying progressive war memory activists, it quickly becomes clear that the apologia by conservative politicians cannot be treated as representative of the opinion of the majority of the Japanese public. Indeed, this book seeks to remedy the disparity between studies devoted to the official level of addressing the 'history issue' and the grass-root historical revisionist movement on the one side, and progressive activism on the other. Furthermore, it contributes to scholarly debates on the state of civil society in Japan, challenging the characterisation of Japanese civil society as a depoliticised space by demonstrating a more contentious side of civil society activism\"--"},"tableOfContents":"Introduction -- Performing the politics of (war) memory -- The actors -- How do you make your voice heard?

Concerned by the fast-changing global environment, they had witnessed the ever-increasing number of incursions into Asia by European powers-not the least of which was Commodore Perry's arrival in Japan in 1853-54 and the forced opening of a handful of Japanese ports at the end of the decade. The Japanese reasoned that it was only a matter of time before they too encountered the same unfortunate fate as China; their hope was to learn from the Chinese experience and to keep foreign powers at bay. They dispatched the Senzaimaru to Shanghai with the purpose of investigating contemporary conditions of trade and diplomacy in the international city.^ Japanese from varied domains, as well as shogunal officials, Nagasaki merchants, and an assortment of deck hands, made the voyage along with a British crew, spending a total of ten weeks observing and interacting with the Chinese and with a handful of Westerners. Roughly a dozen Japanese narratives of the voyage were produced at the time, recounting personal impressions and experiences in Shanghai. The Japanese emissaries had the distinct advantage of being able to communicate with their Chinese hosts by means of the \"brush conversation\" (written exchanges in literary Chinese). For their part, the Chinese authorities also created a paper trail of reports and memorials concerning the Japanese visitors, which worked its way up and down the bureaucratic chain of command.

After their father's death, Harry, Frank, and Pierce Fukuhara-- all born and raised in the Pacific Northwest-- moved to Hiroshima, their mother's ancestral home. Eager to go back to America, Harry returned in the late 1930s. Then came Pearl Harbor. Harry was sent to an internment camp until a call came for Japanese translators and he dutifully volunteered to serve his country. Back in Hiroshima, his brothers Frank and Pierce became soldiers in the Japanese Imperial Army. As the war raged on, Harry, one of the finest bilingual interpreters in the United States Army, island-hopped across the Pacific, moving ever closer to the enemy--^ and to his younger brothers. But before the Fukuharas would have to face each other in battle, the U.S. detonated the atomic bomb over Hiroshima, gravely injuring tens of thousands of civilians, including members of their family. Alternating between the American and Japanese perspectives, Midnight in Broad Daylight captures the uncertainty and intensity of those charged with the fighting as well as the deteriorating home front of Hiroshima-- as never seen before in English--^ and provides a fresh look at the dropping of the first atomic bomb. Intimate and evocative, it is an indelible portrait of a resilient family, a scathing examination of racism and xenophobia, an homage to the tremendous Japanese American contribution to the American war effort, and an invaluable addition to the historical record of this extraordinary time; ''Mother, I am Katsuharu. I have come home.' By the time the reader arrives at this simple, Odysseus-like declaration, she will have been tossed and transported through one of the most wrenching, inspirational-- and until now unknown-- true epics of World War II. Pamela Rotner Sakamoto, in her luminous, magisterial re-assembling of the lives of two Japanese brothers who found themselves on opposite sides of the great conflict, has helped shape and set the standard for a vital and necessary new genre: trans-Pacific literature.

In what proved to be part of a global project, North Korea attempted to reeducate the abductees and train them to spy on the state's behalf. When the project faltered, the abductees were hidden in a series of guarded communities known as \"Invitation-Only Zones\"--the fiction being that these were exclusive enclaves, not prisons. In 2002, Kim Jong Il admitted to kidnapping thirteen Japanese citizens and returned five of them (the other eight, he said, had died). From the moment that Robert S. Boynton first saw a photograph of these men and women, he became obsessed with the window their story provided into the vexed politics of Northeast Asia. In The Invitation-Only Zone, he untangles the logic behind the kidnappings and shows why some Japanese citizens described them as \"their 9/11.\" He tells the story of how dozens were abducted and reeducated; how they married and had children; and how they lived anonymously as North Korean citizens. He speaks with nationalists, diplomats, abductees, and even crab fishermen, unearthing the bizarre North Korean propaganda tactics and the peculiar cultural interests of both counties.

The shaping of bygone eras to contemporary agendas began at least by the early eighth century, when the first court histories, namely the Kojiki and the Nihon shoki, were compiled.Since the late nineteenth century, historians have extensively mined these texts and other written evidence and by the late 1970s had nearly exhausted their meager sources. Fortunately for all those interested in uncovering the origins of Japanese civilization, archaeologists have been hard at work. Today, thanks to this postwar \"archaeology boom,\" Japan historians have never been closer to recreating the lives of prehistoric peasants, ancient princes, and medieval samurai. Sacred Texts and Buried Treasures offers substantial new insights into early Japanese history (A.D. 100-800) through an integrated discussion of historical texts and archaeological artifacts. It contends that the rich archaeological discoveries of the past few decades permit scholars to develop far more satisfactory interpretations of ancient Japan than was possible when they were heavily dependent on written sources."},"tableOfContents":"Frontmatter --  contents --  acknowledgments --  Introduction --  CHAPTER 1.

Once one of the most prosperous ports in the country, Kaminoseki fell into profound economic decline following Japan's reengagement with the West in the late nineteenth century. Using a recently discovered archive and oral histories collected during his years of research in Kaminoseki, Martin Dusinberre reconstructs the lives of households and townspeople as they tried to make sense of their changing place in the world. In challenging the familiar story of modern Japanese growth, Dusinberre provides important new insights into how ordinary people shaped the development of the modern state.Chapters describe the role of local revolutionaries in the Meiji Restoration of 1868, the ways townspeople grasped opportunities to work overseas in the late nineteenth century, and the impact this pan-Pacific diaspora community had on Kaminoseki during the prewar decades. These histories amplify Dusinberre's analysis of postwar rural decline-a phenomenon found not only in Japan but throughout the industrialized Western world. His account comes to a climax when, in the 1980s, the town's councillors request the construction of a nuclear power station, unleashing a storm of protests from within the community. This ongoing nuclear dispute has particular resonance in the wake of the 2011 Fukushima crisis.Hard Times in the Hometown gives voice to personal histories otherwise lost in abandoned archives. By bringing to life the everyday landscape of Kaminoseki, this work offers readers a compelling story through which to better understand not only nineteenth- and twentieth-century Japan but also modern transformations more generally."},"tableOfContents":"Frontmatter -- Contents -- List of Figures and Tables -- Notes on Terms -- Acknowledgments -- Part I.

In his meticulously crafted narrative and analysis, the author reveals how postwar Japanese elites and American occupying authorities collaborated to structure the parameters of remembrance of the war, including the notion that the emperor and his people had been betrayed and duped by militarists. He goes on to explain the Japanese reliance on victim consciousness through a discussion of the ban-the-bomb movement of the mid-1950s, which raised the prominence of Hiroshima as an archetype of war victimhood and brought about the selective focus on Japanese war victimhood; the political strategies of three self-defined war victim groups (A-bomb victims, repatriates, and dispossessed landlords) to gain state compensation and hence valorization of their war victim experiences; shifting textbook narratives that reflected contemporary attitudes and structured future generations' understanding of the war; and three classic antiwar novels and films that contributed to the shaping of a \"sentimental humanism\" that continues to leave a strong imprint on the collective Japanese conscience."},"tableOfContents":"Frontmatter --  Contents --  Acknowledgments --  Chapter 1.

Paul D. Barclay chronicles the lives and times of interpreters, chiefs, and trading-post operators along the far edges of the expanding international system, an area known as Taiwan's \"savage border.\" In addition, he boldly asserts the interpenetration of industrial capitalism and modern ethnic identities. By the 1930s, three decades into Japanese imperial rule, mechanized warfare and bulk commodity production rendered superfluous a whole class of mediators--among them, Kondo \"the Barbarian\" Katsusaburo, Pan Bunkiet, and Iwan Robao. Even with these unreliable allies safely cast aside, the Japanese empire lacked the resources to integrate indigenous Taiwan into the rest of the colony. The empire, therefore, created the Indigenous Territory, which exists to this day as a legacy of Japanese imperialism, local initiatives, and the global commoditization of culture\"--Provided by publisher."},"tableOfContents":"Introduction : empires and indigenous peoples, global transformation and the limits of international society -- From wet diplomacy to scorched earth : the Taiwan expedition, the Guardline and the Wushe rebellion -- The long duree and the short circuit : gender, language and territory in the making of indigenous Taiwan -- Tangled up in red : textiles, trading posts and ethnic bifurcation in Taiwan -- The geobodies within a geobody : the visual economy of race-making and indigeneity.","accessCondition":[{"@type":"restriction on access","#text":"Open Access"},{"@type":"use and reproduction","#text":"This eBook is made available Open Access under a CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 license: "}],"note":[{"@type":"statement of responsibility","#text":"Paul D.

To understand the triumph of the tea plant in Japan, William Wayne Farris begins with its cultivation and goes on to describe the myriad ways in which the herb was processed into a palatable beverage, ultimately resulting in the wide variety of teas we enjoy today. Along the way, he traces in fascinating detail the shift in tea's status from exotic gift item from China, tied to Heian (794-1185) court ritual and medicinal uses, to tax and commodity for exchange in the 1350s, to its complete nativization in Edo (1603-1868) art and literature and its eventual place on the table of every Japanese household.Farris maintains that the increasing sophistication of Japanese agriculture after 1350 is exemplified by tea farming, which became so advanced that Meiji (1868-1912) entrepreneurs were able to export significant amounts of Japanese tea to Euro-American markets. This in turn provided the much-needed foreign capital necessary to help secure Japan a place among the world's industrialized nations. Tea also had a hand in initiating Japan's \"industrious revolution\": From 1400, tea was being drunk in larger quantities by commoners as well as elites, and the stimulating, habit-forming beverage made it possible for laborers to apply handicraft skills in a meticulous, efficient, and prolonged manner. In addition to aiding in the protoindustrialization of Japan by 1800, tea had by that time become a central commodity in the formation of a burgeoning consumer society. The demand-pull of tea consumption necessitated even greater production into the postwar period-and this despite challenges posed to the industry by consumers' growing taste for coffee. A Bowl for a Coin makes a convincing case for how tea-an age-old drink that continues to adapt itself to changing tastes in Japan and the world-can serve as a broad lens through which to view the development of Japanese society over many centuries."},"tableOfContents":"Frontmatter --  Contents --  Acknowledgments --  Maps --  Introduction --  CHAPTER ONE.

Buraku studies, once largely ignored within Japan⁰́₉s academia and by scholarly publishers, have developed considerably in the first decades of the twenty-first century, as the extensive bibliography provided here clearly demonstrates, thereby ensuring that the authors of the present study (2016), translated by the Oxford scholar Ian Neary, have been able to access the most recent data. Because of its importance as the first broadly-based Buraku history, a wider readership was always the authors⁰́₉ principal focus. Yet, it also provides a valuable source book for further study by those wishing to develop their knowledge about the subject from an informed base.

These issues have propelled Japan into the center of a set of global conversations about the nature of children and how to raise them. Engaging both the history of children and childhood and the history of emotions, contributors to this volume track Japanese childhood through a number of historical scenarios. Such explorations--some from Japan's early-modern past--are revealed through letters, diaries, memoirs, family and household records, and religious polemics about promising, rambunctious, sickly, happy, and dutiful youngsters.\"--Provided by publisher."},"tableOfContents":"Nasty boys or obedient children? : childhood and relative autonomy in medieval Japanese monasteries / Or porath -- Growing

Ward explores the Japanese state's efforts to suppress political radicalism in the 1920s and 1930s. Ward traces the evolution of an antiradical law called the Peace Preservation Law, from its initial application to suppress communism and anticolonial nationalism--what authorities deemed thought crime--to its expansion into an elaborate system to reform and ideologically convert thousands of thought criminals throughout the Japanese Empire. To enforce the law, the government enlisted a number of nonstate actors, who included monks, family members, and community leaders. Throughout, Ward illuminates the complex processes through which the law articulated imperial ideology and how this ideology was transformed and disseminated through the law's application over its twenty-year history. In so doing, he shows how the Peace Preservation Law provides a window into understanding how modern states develop ideological apparatuses to subject their respective populations.--"},"tableOfContents":"Introduction: the ghost in the machine: emperor system ideology and the peace preservation law apparatus -- Kokutai and the aporias of imperial sovereignty : the passage of the Peace Preservation Law in 1925 -- Transcriptions of power : repression and rehabilitation in the early Peace Preservation Law apparatus, 1925-1933 -- Apparatuses of subjection : the rehabilitation of thought criminals in the early 1930s -- Nurturing the ideological avowal : toward the codification of tenkō in 1936 -- The ideology of conversion : tenkō on the eve of total war -- Epilogue: the legacies of the thought rehabilitation system in postwar Japan.","note":[{"@type":"statement of responsibility","#text":"Max M.

Early modern scientists in Japan drew on knowledge of Chinese herbal medicine but achieved distinctive insights into plant life commensurate with but separate from their European counterparts. Scholars at the University of Tokyo pioneered Japanese plant biology in the late nineteenth century. They incorporated Western botanical methods but sought a degree of difference in taxonomy while also gaining international legitimacy through publications in English. Japan’s age of empire (1895–1945) was less about plant exploration and more about plant collection, for both scientific and economic benefits. Displays of species from throughout the empire made Japan’s sphere of colonization and conquest visible at home. The infrastructure for research and instruction expanded slowly after World War Two: new laboratories, botanical gardens, scholarly societies, and publications eventually allowed for great diversity of specialized study, especially with the growth of molecular biology in the 1970s and DNA research in the 1980s. Basic research was harmed by cuts in government funding during 2012–2017, but Japanese plant biologists continue to enjoy international esteem in many fields of scholarship."},"tableOfContents":"Frontmatter --  Contents --  Preface --  Introduction --  1.

Using a rich array of source material, J. Charles Schencking tells for the first time the graphic tale of Tokyo's destruction and rebirth. In emotive prose, he documents how the citizens of Tokyo experienced this unprecedented calamity and explores the ways in which it rattled people's deep-seated anxieties about modernity. While explaining how and why the disaster compelled people to reflect on Japanese society, he also examines how reconstruction encouraged the capital's inhabitants to entertain new types of urbanism as they rebuilt their world. Some residents hoped that a grandiose metropolis, reflecting new values, would rise from the ashes of disaster-ravaged Tokyo. Many, however, desired a quick return of the city they once called home. Opportunistic elites advocated innovative state infrastructure to better manage the daily lives of Tokyo residents. Others focused on rejuvenating society -- morally, economically, and spiritually -- to combat the perceived degeneration of Japan. Schencking explores the inspiration behind these dreams and the extent to which they were realized. He investigates why Japanese citizens from all walks of life responded to overtures for renewal with varying degrees of acceptance, ambivalence, and resistance. His research not only sheds light on Japan's experience with and interpretation of the earthquake but challenges widespread assumptions that disasters unite stricken societies, creating a \"blank slate\" for radical transformation. National reconstruction in the wake of the Great Kanto Earthquake, Schencking demonstrates, proved to be illusive. -- Book jacket."},"tableOfContents":"Introduction -- Cataclysm : the earthquake disaster as a lived and reported experience -- Aftermath : the ordeal of restoration and recovery -- Communication : constructing the earthquake as a national tragedy -- Admonishment : interpreting catastrophe as divine punishment -- Optimism : dreams for a new metropolis amid a landscape of ruin -- Contestation : the fractious politics of reconstruction planning -- Regeneration : forging a new Japan through spiritual renewal and fiscal retrenchment -- Readjustment : rebuilding Tokyo from the ashes -- Conclusion.","note":[{"@type":"statement of responsibility","#text":"J.

Later the Japanese government forced the Dutch East India Company representative in Nagasaki to acknowledge that the sailors had in fact been saved from shipwreck and that official recognition of the rescue (i.e., a formal visit from a Dutch ambassador) was in order. Prisoners from Nambu provides a lively, engrossing narrative of this relatively obscure incident, while casting light on the history of the period as a whole. Expertly constructing his tale from primary sources, the author examines relations between the Dutch East India Company and the shogunal government immediately following the promulgation of the \"seclusion laws\" (sakokurei) and anti-Christian campaigns."},"tableOfContents":"Frontmatter --  -DE STERS- --  Contents --  Acknowledgments --  A Note on Titles and Names --  Introduction The Prisoners from Nambu --  Chapter 1.

Professors Hanley and Yamamura argue that a more satisfactory explanation can be provided within the framework of modem economic theory, and they advance and test three important new hypotheses in this book.The authors suggest that the Japanese economy grew throughout the Tokugawa period, though slowly by modern standards and unevenly. This growth, they show, tended to exceed the rate of population increase even in the poorer regions, thus raising the living standard despite major famines. Population growth was controlled by a variety of methods, including abortion and infanticide, for the primary purpose of raising the standard of living. Contrary to the prevailing view of scholars, thus, the conclusions advanced here indicate that the basis for Japan's rapid industrialization in the Meiji period was in many ways already established during the latter part of the Tokugawa period. The authors' analysis combines original fieldwork with study of data based on findings of the postwar years.Originally published in 1978.The Princeton Legacy Library uses the latest print-on-demand technology to again make available previously out-of-print books from the distinguished backlist of Princeton University Press. These editions preserve the original texts of these important books while presenting them in durable paperback and hardcover editions. The goal of the Princeton Legacy Library is to vastly increase access to the rich scholarly heritage found in the thousands of books published by Princeton University Press since its founding in 1905."},"tableOfContents":"Frontmatter --  Contents --  List of Tables and Figures --  Preface --  1.

How are activists changed and movements transformed when they reach out to others a world away? This adept study addresses these questions by tying together local, national, regional, and global historical narratives surrounding the contemporary Japanese environmental movement. Spanning the era of Japanese industrial pollution in the 1960s and the more recent rise of movements addressing global environmental problems, it shows how Japanese activists influenced approaches to environmentalism and industrial pollution in the Asia-Pacific region, North America, and Europe, as well as landmark United Nations conferences in 1972 and 1992. Japan's experiences with diseases caused by industrial pollution produced a potent \"environmental injustice paradigm\" that fueled domestic protest and became the motivation for Japanese groups' activism abroad. From the late 1960s onward Japanese activists organized transnational movements addressing mercury contamination in Europe and North America, industrial pollution throughout East Asia, radioactive waste disposal in the Pacific, and global climate change. In all cases, they advocated strongly for the rights of pollution victims and people living in marginalized communities and nations-a position that often put them at odds with those advocating for the global environment over local or national rights. Transnational involvement profoundly challenged Japanese groups' understanding of and approach to activism. Numerous case studies demonstrate how border-crossing efforts undermined deeply engrained notions of victimhood in the domestic movement and nurtured a more self-reflexive and multidimensional approach to environmental problems and social activism.Transnational Japan in the Global Environmental Movement will appeal to scholars and students interested in the development of civil society, social movements, and environmentalism in contemporary Japan; grassroots inter-Asian connections in the postwar period; and the ways Asian countries and their citizens have shaped and been influenced by global issues like environmentalism."},"tableOfContents":"Japanese industrial pollution and environmental injustice -- The therapy of translocal community -- The human limits to growth : Japanese activists at UNCHE -- Pollution export and victimhood -- Pacific solidarity and atomic aggression -- Globality through local eyes.","targetAudience":"Specialized.","accessCondition":[{"@type":"restriction on access","#text":"Open Access"},{"@type":"use and reproduction","#text":"This eBook is made available Open Access under a CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 license:"}],"note":[{"@type":"statement of responsibility","#text":"Simon Avenell."},"Previously issued in print: 2017.",{"@type":"bibliography","#text":"Includes bibliographical references (pages 275-304) and index."},{"@type":"language","#text":"In English."}],"subject":[{"geographicCode":{"@authority":"marcgac","#text":"a-ja---"}},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":["Environmental protection","History"],"geographic":"Japan"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":["Environmentalism","History"],"geographic":"Japan"},{"@authority":"lcsh","topic":["Green movement","History"],"geographic":"Japan"},{"topic":"Japan."},{"topic":"environmental injustice."},{"topic":"environmentalism."},{"topic":"human rights."},{"topic":"industrial pollution."},{"topic":"social activism."}],"classification":[{"@authority":"lcc","#text":"GE199.J3 A84 2017"},{"@edition":"23","@authority":"ddc","#text":"363.700952"}],"relatedItem":[null,null,{"@otherType":"HOLLIS record","location":{"url":"https://id.lib.harvard.edu/alma/99153648358103941/catalog"}}],"identifier":[{"@type":"isbn","#text":"0-8248-7372-6"},{"@type":"isbn","#text":"0-8248-6716-5"},{"@type":"isbn","#text":"0-8248-6714-9"},{"@type":"doi","#text":"10.1515/9780824867164"},{"@type":"lccn","@invalid":"yes","#text":"2016044857"},{"@type":"oclc","#text":"990722644"},{"@type":"oclc","#text":"974803957"}],"location":[null,null],"extension":[{"librarycloud":{"originalDocument":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/harvard.librarycloud.marc/99153648358103941","processingDate":"2022-07-14T05:12Z"}},{"sets":null}],"recordInfo":{"descriptionStandard":"aacr","recordContentSource":{"@authority":"marcorg","#text":"MdBmJHUP"},"recordCreationDate":{"@encoding":"marc","#text":"160928"},"recordChangeDate":{"@encoding":"iso8601","#text":"20210915"},"recordIdentifier":{"@source":"MH:ALMA","#text":"99153648358103941"},"recordOrigin":"Converted from MARCXML to MODS version 3.6 using MARC21slim2MODS3-6.xsl\n        (Revision 1.117 2017/02/14)"}},{"titleInfo":[{"title":"Investigating Iwo","subTitle":"the flag raisings in myth, memory, & esprit de corps"},{"@type":"alternative","title":"Flag raisings in myth, memory, and esprit de corps"}],"name":[{"@type":"personal","namePart":"Robertson, Breanne","role":{"roleTerm":{"@type":"text","#text":"editor."}}},{"@type":"corporate","namePart":["Marine Corps University (U.S.)","History Division"],"role":{"roleTerm":{"@type":"text","#text":"issuing body."}}}],"typeOfResource":"text","genre":[{"@authority":"marcgt","#text":"bibliography"},{"@authority":"marcgt","#text":"government publication"},{"@authority":"rdacontent","#text":"text"},{"@authority":"fast","#text":"History"}],"originInfo":[{"place":{"placeTerm":[{"@authority":"marccountry","@type":"code","#text":"vau"},{"@authority":"marccountry","@type":"text","#text":"Virginia"}]},"dateIssued":{"@encoding":"marc","#text":"2019"},"issuance":"monographic"},{"place":{"placeTerm":{"@type":"text","#text":"Quantico, Virginia :"}},"publisher":"Marine Corps History Division,","dateIssued":"2019."},{"place":{"placeTerm":{"@type":"text","#text":"Washington, DC :"}},"publisher":"For sale by the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Publishing Office","dateOther":null}],"language":{"languageTerm":[{"@authority":"iso639-2b","@type":"code","#text":"eng"},{"@authority":"iso639-2b","@type":"text","#text":"English"}]},"physicalDescription":{"form":[{"@authority":"marcform","#text":"print"},{"@type":"media","@authority":"rdamedia","#text":"unmediated"},{"@type":"carrier","@authority":"rdacarrier","#text":"volume"}],"extent":"xxviii, 371 pages : illustrations (some color), color maps ;

True, it freed the Japanese press from many wartime constraints. But at the same time, it imposed a large number of new constraints, replacing wartime censorship by the Japanese government with postwar censorship by the American occupation authority. Even before the war ended, planning for the occupation included a censorship and public relations effort that would work to \"re-educate\" the Japanese and fold them into the postwar American international order. Similar efforts were made in Germany, but the effort in Japan was far more sweeping and far more sustained. This book documents that history in detail with extensive references to primary resources held in U.S. archives and elsewhere. Was the occupation successful in reshaping the Japanese mindset? Citing not only the postwar Constitution but also, among other things, the widespread belief in the Tokyo Trials' validity, Etō argues doggedly that it was so successful that its pernicious influence persists even today.

Timon Screech demonstrates that exposure to such Western equipment as lenses, mirrors, and glass had a profound impact on Japanese notions regarding the faculty of sight. The enormity of this paradigm shift was moreover, felt less in the area of Japanese scientific inquiry than in art and popular culture, where these devices were often depicted and used metaphorically, as commentary on prevailing social norms. Based on archival sources here published for the first time in any language, this study also sheds new light on Japanese art and its relation to the West; the relationship of science to art and popular culture; and the autonomy and/or internationalization of Japanese culture."},"tableOfContents":"1.
