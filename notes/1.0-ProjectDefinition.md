# Project Definition: Spotted Dog Library

## Introduction

I've been trying to learn React, among other things. I've found some good resources on general React, but resources on testing are lacking. There's also a lot to be learned by building something and working with it without a guide telling you what to do each step of the way.

So, I'm setting out to build my own application that goes beyond the basics and really digs into realistic development practices.

Topics I want to cover include:

-  Building a moderately complex application
-  Abstracting components for reuse
-  Testing -- components, groups of components (integration), end to end
   -  May require building a backend
-  State management -- I'll start simple, but expect to jump to Redux or similar quickly (because I like Redux's style)
-  Application architecture -- as I go, I want to identify best practices and patterns that work and those that don't
-  TypeScript -- because the type safety and awareness it adds is valuable to me and (IMO) anyone doing more than small scale applications
-  Others TBD

I'll keep notes focused on specific components, features, etc., that I'm building in separate files. But I'll update this document as I go to serve as a central reference for requirements, data, business rules, general component model, and other application-wide concepts. Following this document through different branches and commits should help me (and anyone else looking at this) see how decisions changed over time.

## Business requirements

Spotted Dog Systems is building a solution for public and private libraries to manage their collections and lending.

Libraries own resources (books, periodicals, audio recordings, video recordings, etc.) which they lend to library members (people).

Libraries must be able to

-  Maintain a catalog of resources and information about those resources
   -  Different types of resources may have different information; for example
      -  Books have a title, author, publisher, optional volume number, and International Standard Book Number (ISBN)
      -  Periodicals have a title, publisher, volume number, issue number, and International Standard Serial Number (ISSN)
-  Maintain a list of library members
   -  Information about library members includes name, mailing address, email address, phone number, age (may affect materials a member can borrow), and responsible member (if a minor child is a member, the responsible member is the child's parent or guardian), member id (library card number)
   -  Library members may borrow resources; non-members may use resource in the library, but may not borrow resources
-  Allow library users (may or may not be members) to find resources in the catalog
-  Lend resources to library members
   -  Information about a loan includes date of loan, date due, resource, member
   -  Some resources may be lendable, others may not; the library catalogs all resources regardless of lendable status
   -  Members may renew a loan without returning the resource; libraries may limit renewals and renewal duration
-  Identify which member currently has a resource
-  Notify members of overdue resources and fines

Distinction: library users include library members and non-members

In the future, the solution will support features like

-  Reserve a resource: designate a resource for in-library use only; overrides resource's default lendable status; common in educational institution libraries where an instructor may place materials on reserve for their classes' use
-  Hold a resource: allow a member to request that, when a lent or reserved resource is available for checkout, they be notified and the resource be held for them to borrow
-  Support nontraditional resources: some libraries allow users to reserve computers, meeting rooms, etc.; these may or may not be "resources"

## Data

### Resource

Description: an item the library owns and makes available for library users

Types: book, periodical, audio recording, video recording, others TBD

Attributes:

-  ResourceId: uniquely identifies the resource in the library
-  ResourceTypeCode: identifies the resource's subtype
-  CallNumber: describes where the resource is physically located in the library
   -  Common systems include Dewey Decimal and Library of Congress in the US
   -  Call numbers are usually formatted in several lines with a defined structure
-  LendableFlag: identifies if a member may borrow the resource
-  ResourceTitle: the name by which the resource is known
-  PublisherName: Name of the person or organization that published the resource
-  PublishedDate: when the resource was issued; may be year, month + year; for periodicals, may also be day + month + year; time is unlikely

I expect I'll add other attributes including a summary, age restriction, etc., but this is enough to get started.

Book attributes:

-  AuthorName: Name of the person or names of the people who wrote the book
   -  In the future, Author, Editor, and other roles may be described in relationships between people and resources; for now, I'm keeing it simple
-  SeriesName: optional; if the book is part of a series of books, the name of the series
-  VolumeNumber: optional; if the book is part of a series of books, the number of the book in the series
-  ISBN: the International Standard Book Number assigned to the book

Periodical attributes:

-  EditorName: name of the person designated as the primary or chief editor of the periodical
-  VolumeNumber: the series volume number of which the issue is part
-  IssueNumber: the specific issue's number in the volume
-  ISSN: the International Standard Serial Number assigned to the issue

Some attributes are on their respective subtypes because we know they may not apply to audio and video recordings. I could define print resources and non-print resources to distinguish those things, but that abstraction doesn't add value at the moment.

### Person

Description: an individual about whom the library chooses to keep information

I'm using the more generic "person" because a person may play several roles (borrower, person who places a reserve, person who places a hold, etc.).

Attributes:

-  PersonId: uniquely identifies the person
-  LastName
-  FirstName

I'm using US-like attribute names to avoid the complexity of

Member attributes:

-  AddressLine1
-  AddressLine2
-  CityName: a first level subdivision of a county or state if the state does not have counties
-  CountyName: optional; a first level subdivision of a state; may go by other names outside the US
-  StateCode: a first level subdivision of a country; may go by other names (province, canton, etc.,) outside the US
-  PostalCode: optional; text assigned by the local postal authority to help route mail; in the US, ZIP code
-  Country: a geographic region recognized as a soverign entity by international standard (ISO/UN)
-  EmailAddress
-  TelephoneNumber
-  MemberId: alphanumeric; a value used to identify the member; typically a library card number; may change over time

MemberId is not a persistent identifier for the member, so shouldn't be confused with other unique identifiers. It's a string of some kind, often on a physical card. If a member loses their physical card or it is destroyed, they may be issued a card with a new MemberId. Different libraries may use different member id formats and may change formats over time.

I expect I'll add birth date when I get to the concept of age restricted resources.

I expect I'll have other sets of attributes for people who are not members (authors, editors, etc.).

### ResourceLoan

Description: relates a resource to a member who is borrowing that resource

Attributes:

-  ResourceId
-  MemberId
-  LoanedDate: the date on which the member borrowed the resource
-  LoanDueDate: the date after which an unreturned or unrenewed loan is considered overdue (may be subject to fines)
-  ReturnedDate: the date on which the member returned the resource or renewed the loan
-  RenewedFlag: indicates if the loan was renewed instead of returned
-  RenewalCount: the number of times the loan has been renewed

A renewal is recorded as a new loan. RenewalCount is 0 for the initial loan, 1 for the loan representing the first renewal, etc. It is used to limit renewals, if the library has a renewal limit policy. Renewing a loan is treated as returning the original loan.

Resource reserves and resource holds are also resource to member relationships, but have different attributes.

## Features

-  View a resource
-  Find a resource (title, author, etc.)
   -  Will probably lead me to some kind of backend
-  Lend a resource
-  Create/update a resource
-  Return a loaned resource resource
-  Renew a loaned resource (return original loan and lend again)
-  Create/update a member

## Project setup

I did this before I started taking notes, but I should describe what I did.

Create the repo on GitHub with MIT license, `README.md`, Node `.gitignore`

The, on local:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jmjf/sd-library
npx create-react-app sd-library --template typescript
cd sd-library
mkdir notes
```

Later:

-  Move dependencies to dev dependencies with `npm install --save-dev @testing-library/jest-dom @types/jest @types/node @types/react @types/react-dom ts-jest ts-node typescript`
-  Fix `README.md` after CRA changed it; remove `README.old.md`
