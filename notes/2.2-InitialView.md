# Initial view for resources

## Story: Display a list of resources

I want to create a base view for resources that displays the data on the screen so users can see information about the resource.

-  When a user navigates to the page, it should display all the resources
-  When the resource is a book, the resource display should include book information only
-  When the resources is a periodical, the resource display should include periodical information only

### Planning notes

-  Initially, just load the data from `db/data.json` into an array
-  Base view is ugly at this stage, but improvements are coming
-  Key goal here is to get a component on the page with some data so I have the basics working as it should

## Dev notes

-  create `src/components` (not sure this is the best long term strategy, but I'll start like this and rearrange later)

   -  `ViewResource.tsx` (I'm staring with a component that will display a single resource)
   -  I'm going to use the `Resource` interface and probably some others
   -  Write the component JSX
   -  Install dev dependencies eslint, prettier, and eslint-config-prettier (because formatting is easier)
      **COMMIT: CHORE: add eslint, prettier, eslint-config-prettier**
   -  Copy `.eslintrc.json` and `.prettierrc.json` from another project that I set up my way

-  I need an easy way to get data so...

   -  create `src/temp` (place to hold stuff I want to eliminate later)
   -  `resources.ts` -> exports `JSON.parse()` of a copy of `data.json`
   -  now I can just import it

-  I need a component to get the data and `map()` it

   -  `ListResources.tsx`
   -  `map()` resources to display `ViewResource` elements for each resource

-  Now put it in the App

Issues

-  eslint complains about spacing and other details
   -  Save files (prettier handles spacing) and adjust other issues
-  `publishedDate.toString` is not a function (in dev tools)
   -  It's a string when it should be a Date
   -  In `ListResources`, ensure it's a Date
-  add some space between resources
-  format date as mmm yyyy (using `Intl.DateTimeFormat().format`)

## Story: choose a UI library

I want to find a UI library that gives me UI widgets that are better looking and more capable than building directly on default controls.

UI library requirements

-  Looks good
-  Accessibility
-  Has UI controls I'm likely to need
-  Customizeable

-  https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-libraries/

Based on the first two, my short list is probably MUI, React Bootstrap, ReactStrap, PrimeReact. Third link recommends MUI, Chakra UI, Mantine.

-  Bootstrap options seem rather light on features. I'm not particularly thrilled by them compared to others.
-  MUI is familiar. I've used Material Design before. I am not excited about it's locked in styling that's hard to change.
-  Mantine and Chakra are both nice looking (slick) libraries that share a common base (emotion). Mantine's community seems small. Chakra is smaller than MUI, but decently sized (based on npmjs weekly downloads).
-  PrimeReact doesn't seem to be based on emotion, but is still slick and comparable in terms of flexibility. Community size is a concern. I'm also less confident about its accessibility chops.

I'm leaning toward Chakra. It requires more code (CSS-in-JS model) and will require more learning, but it's definitely stronger than Bootstrap or MUI for themeing and similar customization and has a lot of good accessibility tips in the docs.

## Story: Apply UI library

I want to apply the UI library to may base view so I have a better looking, more capable view.

## Story: Add a list of resources

I want to add a list of resources so the user can select a single resource more easily.

-  When the user navigates to the page, it should display a list of resource types and titles
-  When the user clicks on a resource title, it should display the resource
