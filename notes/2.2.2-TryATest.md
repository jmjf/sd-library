# Try a test

I want to write a test that will click rows in `ListResources` and confirm it displays the correct resource.

-  Correct resource means resourceId displayed on screen matches the key of the row (ideally)
-  Which I may be able to do based on the resource id in the state
-  Need to be able to control the resources array for testing, so need a way to inject resource data

Not a super sophisticated test, but the point it to figure out how to do a basic test like this and then look at what makes sense to test.

## Setup

-  Install React Testing Library - `npm install --save-dev @testing-library/react`
-  And RTL says to install jest-environment-jsdom too
   -  Reference: https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/setup#jest-28
   -  `npm install --save-dev jest-environment-jsdom`

## Notes

-  I want to render the `ListResources` component with data I choose, so it needs to accept data as a prop
-  Assertions

   -  No text from `ViewResource` is on screen
   -  Text for the table is on screen

-  I want to click a row in the table
-  Assertions
   -  Text from `ViewResource` is on screen and matches the row clicked

Tests

-  when first rendered, it shows a list of resources and no resource detail
   -  "Resource Title" should be on the screen (`getByText`)
   -  "Resource Id" should not be on the screen (`queryByText` -- returns null if not found)
-  when a resource in the list is clicked, it shows the resource detail for that resource
   -  "Resource Title" should be on the screen (`getByText`)
   -  "Resource Id" should be on the screen (`getByText`)
   -  The item's resource id should be on the screen (`getByText`)
-  when a second resource in the list is clicked, it shows the resource detail for that resource
   -  If the previous test passes, we don't need to assert for the same conditions, after clicking second item
   -  "Resource Title" should be on the screen (`getByText`)
   -  "Resource Id" should be on the screen (`getByText`)
   -  The item's resource id should be on the screen (`getByText`)

Questions

-  If I `getByText` to find what to click, how do I select the row instead of the cell
   -  Add a `data-testid` that is the resource id and use `getByTestId`
   -  Or will clicking the cell trigger the row's click handler? -- I'll try it and see what happens
-  Triggering events
   -  `fireEvent.click(getByText(resource[0].resourceTitle));` -- to try clicking on cell
   -  `fireEvent.click(getByTestId(resource[0].resourceId));` -- to click on `<tr>` by `data-testid`

Test data

-  use the six resources from the data I have

## Dev notes

-  Get resources in `App` and pass as a prop to `ListResources`
-  Add `ListResources.test.tsx`
   -  Wasn't happy with a `.ts` because it didn't know how to intepret React elements
-  Import React
   -  Seems to be required here
-  Also need to `npm install --save-dev` and import `@testing-library/jest-dom` to get matchers
-  Jest isn't happy because I don't have a config telling it to use TypeScript
   -  Set up `jest.config.ts`, which takes several tries to get right
      -  `npx ts-jest config:init` created a JS file
      -  renamed to `.ts`
      -  changed export because it was exporting for CJS
      -  changed `testEnvironment` in config to jsdom

I set up the first test with `getByText` and `not.toBeInTheDocument()`, expecting it might fail and it does--"Resource Id" is not in the document so `getById` throws.

-  Change to use `queryByText` and `toBeNull()` and it works

I set up the second test and it's complaining that it can't find "Resource Id", probably because it's looking at the whole element text, which includes a ":". Let's use a regex here.

Similar issue with resource id, but I had to construct a regex (`new RegExp()`).

Now it's all working. Based on the render trees the failures showed (plus induced failure in the last test), it's testing as I'd expect it to test.

**COMMIT: TEST: get tests working; test ListResources** Reference: test ListResources
