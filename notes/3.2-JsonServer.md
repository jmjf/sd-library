# Set up json-server

Start with docs at `https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server`.

-  `npm install --save-dev json-server`
   -  I wouldn't use this as a "production" solution, but it's good for basic dev.
   -  I'll add a real API eventually, maybe.
-  Edit `db/harvard.data.json`, wrap the array in an object and name the array `resources`.
-  Rename `db/harvard.data.json` to `db/hvd.data.json` -- to ensure we have a copy separate from what the data prep writes
   -  Also copy it and make a `.bak` version for extra safety.
-  `http://localhost:3000/resources?q=Kodansha` returns a list of resources with "Kodansha" in them
   -  Can also use the `_like` suffix on a name
   -  Author data is in an array of objects; no clear way to get to them; may need to `?q=` and have the React code (for now) filter it
-  Add a `package.json` script to start json-server
   -  `"db": "npx json-server -w db/hvd.data.json -p 3030"`

I need to regenerate my data with ids to make data management practical. I can probably find an id in the Harvard data, but I'll use a UUID id because it's easy.

-  `npm install --save-dev uuid`
-  Edit `db/prepare-data.js` to add a uuid to the objects it generates as `resourceId`
   -  Also do the object wrap
   -  Author name extract still allowed Asian characters through, so changed to require `[A-Za-z]+`
-  Tell json-server the id is `resourceId`
   -  Add `-i resourceId` to the script
-  Instead of `hvd.data.json`, let it use `harvard.data.json`
   -  Instead of `.bak` file, just leave default "copy" filename

**COMMIT: CHORE: set up json-server; changes to prepare-data to work with it better** Reference: json-server setup
