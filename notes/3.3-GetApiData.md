# Get data from the API (json-server)

## Planning

Goal: Pull data from the API and use it in `ListResources` to confirm I have a working process for getting data

-  Future steps will build a search input component to drive the API request

Thinking ahead a bit

-  Put the data getter in `ListResources` (keep it simple for now; move it elsewhere later)
-  The search input can pass state to `ListResources` in the URL (search button navigates to `ListResources`)
-  Pass seach parameters to the getter; let it form the query (UI doesn't need to know how to do that)

So, `useEffect` in `ListResources`. For now, it will run a fixed query.

### Component naming conventions

-  Look at component naming conventions; how do others name components sanely
-  Maybe `SearchResults`, `ResourceList`, `Resource`
-  But then what if I have view, edit, etc., variants or complete vs. subset views
   -  What if "edit" is just "create" with data instead of none
   -  What if "view" is the same form with a property that disables data input

Ideas from

-  https://airbnb.io/javascript/react/#naming
   -  ReservationCard -> pattern here is function + visual component type
   -  Footer -> function and visual component are the same
-  https://charlypoly.com/publications/react-components-naming-convention
   -  [Domain][page/context][ComponentName][type]
   -  Domain -> which product owns the component; maybe map to DDD domain concept, module/feature
   -  Page/Context -> where does the component belong (root (default), parent, page, subpage, etc.)
   -  ComponentName -> what does the component do; function or concept
   -  Type -> View (default) | Button | Input, Upload, other form types | Component (HOC wrapped components)
   -  Examples: Sidebar (component name), SidebarSwitch (context + component), AddToShortListButton (component + type)
   -  This would lead me to names like `ResourceSearch`, `ResourceList`, `ResourceView`
-  https://github.com/bbc/simorgh/tree/latest/src/app/pages
   -  Patterns I see: [Page/context][container | section | sectionlabel | wrapper]
   -  Page level components: `FrontPage`, `ArticlePage`
   -  Atom components: `VisuallyHiddenText`, `Image`, `Paragraph`, `Timestamp` (assumed)
   -  Molecules: `ArticleMetadata`
   -  Organisms: `SocialEmbedContainer` (maybe)
   -  They sometimes customize components based on context
      -  `FrontPageMostReadSection = styled(MostReadSection)`...
      -  `StyledRadioScheduleContainer = styled(RadioScheduleContainer)`...
   -  I think they're using some form of Atomic Design (https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design)

So, what if I use CharlyPoly's base structure, but add types that make sense to me from an Atomic Design perspective influenced by the BBC? Including `Page` for page level components. The idea being, all the other components are used on a page and pages contain other components with few, if any standard components.

-  `ResourceSearchPage`
   -  Search inputs and button for "search"
   -  Navigates to `ResourceSearchResultsPage`
-  `ResourceSearchResultsPage` (replaces `ListResources`)
   -  `ResourceList` displays the list of results (replaces `ResourcesList`)
   -  `ResourceView` displays a single result (replaces `ViewResource`)
-  `ResourceViewPage`
   -  use `ResourceView` as a full page
-  `ResourceViewListPage`
   -  several `ResourceView` on a single page

### Key things to do

-  Change `Resource` interface to match the data
-  Change `ListResources`, `ResourcesList` and `ViewResource` to use the new data format
-  Write `useEffect` in `ListResources`
-  Rename components and adjust everything

Renamed branch to `get-data-from-api` because all this prep for find is getting out too large. Find will be a future branch.
